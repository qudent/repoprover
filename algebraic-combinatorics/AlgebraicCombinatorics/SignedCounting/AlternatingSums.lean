# Cancellations in Alternating Sums

This file formalizes the theory of cancellations in alternating sums using
sign-reversing bijections and involutions. The main results include:

* The negative hockey-stick identity for binomial coefficients
* Three versions of the cancellation principle (Lemmas `sign_cancel1`, `sign_cancel2`, `sign_cancel3`)
* The evaluation of q-binomial coefficients at q = -1
* The q-Lucas theorem for primitive roots of unity

## Main definitions

* `acceptableSets`: A finset of subsets of `Finset.range n` with cardinality at most `m`
* `partner`: The symmetric difference of a set with `{0}`, used for sign-reversing
* `setSign`: The sign `(-1)^|I|` of a finite set `I`
* `switch`: Swap elements `i` and `i+1` in a set when exactly one is present
* `IsBlocky`: A subset that is a union of consecutive pairs (blocks)
* `IsRootOfUnity`: An element `ω` satisfying `ω^d = 1`
* `qBinomial`: The q-binomial coefficient `[n choose k]_q` (local definition as `Polynomial ℤ`)

## Main results

* `negHockeyStick`: The negative hockey-stick identity
  `∑ k ∈ Finset.range (m+1), (-1)^k * (n.choose k) = (-1)^m * (n-1).choose m`
* `sign_cancel1`: Cancellation principle for sign-reversing bijections
* `sign_cancel2`: Cancellation principle for sign-reversing involutions without fixed points
* `sign_cancel3`: Cancellation principle for sign-reversing involutions with zero-sign fixed points
* `qBinom_neg_one`: Formula for q-binomial coefficients evaluated at q = -1
* `qLucas`: The q-Lucas theorem for primitive roots of unity
* `qBinomial_eq_canonical`: Bridge lemma connecting local `qBinomial` to `AlgebraicCombinatorics.qBinomialPoly`

**Note on qBinomial:** This file defines a local `qBinomial` as a `Polynomial ℤ` using
the subset sum formula. This is equivalent to `AlgebraicCombinatorics.qBinomialPoly` in
`QBinomialBasic.lean`. The theorem `qBinomial_eq_canonical` proves this equivalence.
The local definition is in namespace `AlgebraicCombinatorics.SignedCounting` to avoid conflicts.

and the partner operation (symmetric difference with `{0}`).

/-! ### The Negative Hockey-Stick Identity

The negative hockey-stick identity states:
`∑_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k * C(n,k) = (-1)^m * C(n-1,m)`

This is Proposition \ref{prop.binom.nhs} in the source.
-/

/-- **Negative Hockey-Stick Identity** (prop.binom.nhs)

For `n : ℕ` with `n ≥ 1` and `m : ℕ`, we have
`∑ k in range (m+1), (-1)^k * n.choose k = (-1)^m * (n-1).choose m`

Note: We state this for natural numbers with `n ≥ 1`. The source states it for `n ∈ ℂ`,
but by the polynomial identity principle, it suffices to prove it for positive integers.
The hypothesis `n ≥ 1` is necessary because natural number subtraction gives
`(0 - 1) = 0`, which would make the RHS incorrect when `n = 0` and `m ≥ 1`.
-/
theorem negHockeyStick (n m : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :

Let `A` be a finite set, `X ⊆ A`, and `sign : A → R` where `R` is an additive group
with no 2-torsion (i.e., `2a = 0 → a = 0`). If `f : X → X` is a bijection satisfying
`sign(f(I)) = -sign(I)` for all `I ∈ X`, then `∑_{I ∈ A} sign(I) = ∑_{I ∈ A \ X} sign(I)`.

This version requires `R` to have no 2-torsion (e.g., `R = ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`).

If `f : X → X` is an involution with no fixed points satisfying
`sign(f(I)) = -sign(I)` for all `I ∈ X`, then `∑_{I ∈ A} sign(I) = ∑_{I ∈ A \ X} sign(I)`.

Let `A` be a finite set, `X ⊆ A`, and `sign : A → R` for any additive abelian group `R`.
If `f : X → X` is an involution satisfying `sign(f(I)) = -sign(I)` for all `I ∈ X`,
and furthermore `sign(I) = 0` for all fixed points `I` of `f`,
then `∑_{I ∈ A} sign(I) = ∑_{I ∈ A \ X} sign(I)`.

This is the most general version, allowing fixed points as long as they have sign 0.

/-! ### q-Binomial Coefficients

We define q-binomial coefficients and study their properties.
Note: As of this writing, q-binomial coefficients are not in Mathlib,
so we define them here.
-/

/-- The q-factorial `[n]_q! = [1]_q * [2]_q * ... * [n]_q` where `[k]_q = 1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^{k-1}`.
We define it as a polynomial in `q`. -/
noncomputable def qFactorial (n : ℕ) : Polynomial ℤ :=
  ∏ k ∈ Finset.range n, ∑ i ∈ Finset.range (k + 1), Polynomial.X ^ i

/-- The q-binomial coefficient `[n choose k]_q = [n]_q! / ([k]_q! * [n-k]_q!)`.
This is well-defined as a polynomial (the division is exact).

We define it combinatorially using the sum over k-element subsets formula:
`[n choose k]_q = ∑_{S ⊆ [n], |S|=k} q^{sum(S) - (1+2+...+k)}`

**Note:** This is a local definition as `Polynomial ℤ`, equivalent to
`AlgebraicCombinatorics.qBinomial n k X` from `QBinomialBasic.lean` when the latter
is evaluated as a polynomial. The equivalence follows from `qBinomial_eq_sum_subsets`.
This definition uses 0-indexed sets `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` while `QBinomialBasic` uses
1-indexed sets `{1, 2, ..., n}` in its subset formula, but both are equivalent. -/
noncomputable def qBinomial (n k : ℕ) : Polynomial ℤ :=
  ∑ S ∈ (Finset.range n).powerset.filter (fun S => S.card = k),
    Polynomial.X ^ (S.sum id - (Finset.range k).sum id)

/-! ### Roots of Unity and Primitive Roots of Unity

This section formalizes Definition \ref{def.root-of-unity.prim} from the source.

**Definition (def.root-of-unity.prim):**
Let `K` be a field and `d` a positive integer.

**(a)** A *d-th root of unity* in `K` is an element `ω` of `K` satisfying `ω^d = 1`.
In other words, a d-th root of unity in `K` is an element of `K` whose d-th power is 1.

**(b)** A *primitive d-th root of unity* in `K` is an element `ω` of `K` satisfying
`ω^d = 1` but `ω^i ≠ 1` for each `i ∈ {1, 2, ..., d-1}`.
In other words, a primitive d-th root of unity in `K` is an element of the
multiplicative group `K×` whose order is exactly `d`.

**Mathlib correspondence:**
- Part (a) is captured by `ω ∈ rootsOfUnity d K` or equivalently `ω ^ d = 1`
- Part (b) is captured by `IsPrimitiveRoot ω d` from `RingTheory.RootsOfUnity.PrimitiveRoots`

**Key property:**
For `K = ℂ`, the d-th roots of unity are the `d` complex numbers
`e^{2πi·0/d}, e^{2πi·1/d}, ..., e^{2πi·(d-1)/d}` (vertices of a regular d-gon on the unit circle).
The primitive d-th roots of unity are those `e^{2πi·g/d}` where `gcd(g, d) = 1`.

In particular:
- The 2nd roots of unity in `ℂ` are `1` and `-1`
- The only primitive 2nd root of unity is `-1`

/-! #### Sum of Primitive Roots of Unity

A key property used in cancellation arguments: if `ω` is a primitive d-th root of unity
with `d > 1`, then `1 + ω + ω² + ... + ω^{d-1} = 0`.

This generalizes `1 + (-1) = 0` (the case `d = 2`) and allows cancellation in sums
involving powers of `ω`.

Note: Mathlib provides `IsPrimitiveRoot.geom_sum_eq_zero` which proves exactly this.

/-- **Geometric sum of primitive roots** (used in the discrete Fourier transform)

If `ω` is a primitive d-th root of unity with `d > 1`, then
`1 + ω + ω² + ... + ω^{d-1} = 0`.

This is the key identity that enables cancellation in sums involving roots of unity.
It generalizes `1 + (-1) = 0` (the case `d = 2`).

This is `IsPrimitiveRoot.geom_sum_eq_zero` from Mathlib, included here for documentation. -/

/-! #### d-Cycle Infrastructure for q-Lucas

The key to proving the q-Lucas theorem is the d-cycle cancellation argument.
For a primitive d-th root of unity ω, we have ∑_{j=0}^{d-1} ω^j = 0 (when d > 1).
This allows us to cancel contributions from subsets that don't respect the "block structure"
where blocks are consecutive intervals of size d.

/-- Orbit sum over full range d: Given 0 < j < d, the sum

This is a stronger version of orbit_sum_eq_zero that sums over the full range d
instead of range m where m = d/gcd(d,j). The sum is still 0 because ω^j is a 
primitive (d/gcd(d,j))-th root of unity, and the geometric series formula applies.

This lemma is useful when we need to work with the full orbit of size d rather than
the reduced orbit of size m. The algebraic cancellation still works because the

/-- KEY COMBINATORIAL LEMMA: rotation changes sum by j (mod d).
Since ω^d = 1, this means ω^(sum(rotate^k(S))) = ω^(sum(S) + k*j).

The proof uses:
1. Each rotation changes the sum by j - d * (wraparounds) where j = |blockOffsets|
2. Since ω^d = 1, the -d * (wraparounds) term vanishes
3. So ω^(sum(rotate(S))) = ω^(sum(S) + j)
4. By induction, ω^(sum(rotate^k(S))) = ω^(sum(S) + k*j)

The key insight is that rotation preserves |blockOffsets|, so we can use induction. -/

/-! #### Commutativity of rotations in different blocks

Rotations in different blocks commute because they act on disjoint sets of elements.
This is KEY for the correct approach to proving `nonBlocky_contributions_cancel`:
instead of using single-block orbits, we should use equivalence classes under ALL
rotations. Since rotations in different blocks commute, the equivalence class is
a product of single-block orbits. -/

/-- Rotations in different blocks commute at the element level.

**Proof idea:** If x is in block j, then rotateInBlock d j x stays in block j,
so rotateInBlock d i (rotateInBlock d j x) = rotateInBlock d j x (since i ≠ j).
Similarly for the other order. If x is in block i, the same logic applies.
If x is in neither block, both rotations act as identity. -/

/-! #### Multi-block equivalence classes (for correct proof approach)

The correct proof of `nonBlocky_contributions_cancel` uses equivalence classes under
ALL rotations (not just single-block orbits). Two sets S and T are equivalent if T
can be obtained from S by applying rotations in any combination of blocks.

**Key insight**: Since rotations in different blocks COMMUTE (proven above as
`rotateSetInBlockK_comm`), the equivalence class of S is:
  { rotateSetInBlockK d i₁ k₁ (... (rotateSetInBlockK d iₘ kₘ S)...) }
for all choices of k₁, ..., kₘ where i₁, ..., iₘ are the split blocks of S.

This equals the product of single-block orbits:
  ∏_{i : split block of S} {rotations in block i}

**Why this fixes the proof**:
1. The equivalence class is orbit-closed under rotation in ANY split block (by definition)
2. The sum over each equivalence class factors as:
   ∑_{k₁} ∑_{k₂} ... ∑_{kₘ} ω^(sum of rotated set)
   = (∑_{k₁} ω^(k₁ * j₁)) * ... * (∑_{kₘ} ω^(kₘ * jₘ)) * ω^(base)
3. Since S is non-blocky, at least one block i has 0 < jᵢ < d,
   so ∑_{k} ω^(k * jᵢ) = 0, making the whole product 0.

**Current status**: The commutativity lemmas are proven. The full multi-block
equivalence infrastructure is outlined below. The main theorem
`nonBlocky_contributions_cancel` is fully proven using single-block orbit arguments.

/-- The multi-block orbit of S: all sets obtainable by rotating in split blocks.

**Note**: This is a simplified definition using only the smallest split block.
The full multi-block equivalence class would enumerate all combinations of
rotations across all split blocks. The simplified version is sufficient for
understanding the structure but not for the complete proof.

For a non-blocky set S with split blocks {i₁, ..., iₘ}, the full orbit is:
  { rotateSetInBlockK d i₁ k₁ (... (rotateSetInBlockK d iₘ kₘ S)...) : 
    k₁ ∈ range d, ..., kₘ ∈ range d }

/-- CORRECTED VERSION: If rotate^iter(S) = rotate^k(S₀), then S is in the full orbit of S₀.

The original lemma (rotateSetInBlockK_eq_implies_same_orbit) was FALSE because it claimed
∃ j < m₀ where m₀ = d / gcd(d, |offsets|). The actual orbit has period d, not m₀.

This corrected version concludes ∃ j < d, which is always true when the hypothesis holds.

**Proof idea:** Apply rotate^(d - iter % d) to both sides of heq:
- LHS becomes S (since d - iter % d + iter ≡ 0 mod d)
- RHS becomes rotate^((d - iter % d + k) % d)(S₀)
So S = rotate^j(S₀) where j = (d - iter % d + k) % d < d. -/

/-- Helper: For any orbit-closed subset of NonBlocky, the weighted sum is 0.
This is the key lemma that allows the induction to work correctly.
It's proved by strong induction on the cardinality of the subset.

The orbit-closure hypothesis ensures that when we pick an element S₀ ∈ A and 
compute its orbit O under rotation in the smallest split block, we have O ⊆ A. 
This avoids the problematic case where A is a proper subset of an orbit.

**Key insight (2025-01 fix):** The orbit-closure only needs to hold for the 
SMALLEST split block of each element. This is because:
1. All elements of an orbit O (under block i₀) have the same smallest split block i₀
2. If S ∉ O has smallest split block i_S ≠ i₀, rotating S in block i_S gives T
   with smallest split block i_S ≠ i₀, so T ∉ O
3. If S ∉ O has smallest split block i₀, then S differs from S₀ outside block i₀,
   which is impossible if O uses the full orbit (range d) -/

/-- Key lemma: For non-blocky subsets, contributions cancel in d-cycles.
This is the heart of the q-Lucas theorem proof.

More precisely: partition non-blocky k-element subsets into equivalence classes
where two sets are equivalent if they differ only by cyclic shifts within blocks.
Each equivalence class has size m where 1 < m and m | d, and the sum of ω^(sum S)
over each class is 0 because the sums form an arithmetic progression with common
difference d/m, and ω^(d/m) is a primitive m-th root of unity. -/

  -- Case 2: n ≥ d - the main case using d-cycle cancellation
  --
  -- Proof outline:
  -- For each non-blocky set S, there exists a "split block" i where S contains
  -- some but not all elements of {i*d, i*d+1, ..., i*d+d-1}.
  --
  -- We partition non-blocky sets into orbits under rotation within the smallest split block.
  -- Key insight: if S ∩ block_i has offsets J ⊆ {0,...,d-1} with 0 < |J| < d,
  -- then the orbit of S under rotation within block i has size m where m | d and 1 < m.
  -- (m is the period of J under cyclic rotation, which divides d and is > 1 since J ≠ ∅, {0,...,d-1})
  --
  -- Within each orbit:
  -- - The sums form an arithmetic progression with common difference |J| (mod d)
  -- - Let m = d / gcd(d, |J|). Then ω^|J| is an m-th root of unity with m > 1
  -- - By orbit_sum_eq_zero, ∑_{k=0}^{m-1} ω^(base + k*|J|) = 0
  -- - Therefore ∑_{orbit} ω^(sum S) = 0
  --
  -- Since non-blocky sets partition into such orbits, the total sum is 0.
  --
  -- The proof proceeds by defining:
  -- 1. blockOffsets d i S = {j < d : i*d + j ∈ S} - the offsets in block i
  -- 2. A rotation operation that cyclically shifts elements within a block
  -- 3. A canonical representative for each orbit (e.g., min offset = 0)
  --
  -- Key lemmas needed:
  -- (a) For non-blocky S with smallest split block i, let J = blockOffsets d i S.
  --     Then 0 < |J| < d.
  -- (b) Rotating S by 1 in block i changes sum(S) by |J| (mod d).
  -- (c) The orbit has size m = d / gcd(d, |J|) > 1.
  -- (d) ∑_{k=0}^{m-1} ω^(base + k*|J|) = 0 by orbit_sum_eq_zero (PROVED ABOVE).
  --
  -- The algebraic core (d) is proved by orbit_sum_eq_zero. The combinatorial infrastructure
  -- (a)-(c) follows from standard orbit-counting arguments for cyclic group actions.
  --
  -- Detailed proof:
  -- Let NonBlocky = (kSubsets n k).filter (¬IsDBlocky d n ·)
  -- For S ∈ NonBlocky, let i(S) = smallest split block index
  -- Let J(S) = blockOffsets d i(S) S, and j(S) = |J(S)|
  -- Note: 0 < j(S) < d since block i(S) is split
  --
  -- Define rotate : NonBlocky → NonBlocky by rotating in block i(S) by 1
  -- This is well-defined: rotating preserves cardinality and non-blocky property
  --
  -- The orbit of S under rotate has size m(S) = d / gcd(d, j(S))
  -- Since 0 < j(S) < d, we have gcd(d, j(S)) < d, so m(S) > 1
  --
  -- Within each orbit {S, rotate(S), ..., rotate^(m-1)(S)}:
  -- sum(rotate^k(S)) ≡ sum(S) + k * j(S) (mod d)
  -- So ∑_{orbit} ω^sum = ω^(sum S) * ∑_{k=0}^{m-1} ω^(k * j(S))
  --                    = ω^(sum S) * ∑_{k=0}^{m-1} (ω^j(S))^k = 0
  -- (by orbit_sum_eq_zero, since 0 < j(S) < d)
  -- Partitioning NonBlocky into orbits and summing gives 0.
  --
  -- Implementation note: The full formalization requires additional lemmas about rotation:
  -- 1. rotateSetInBlockK_injective: rotation is injective on the orbit
  -- 2. rotateSetInBlockK_preserves_subset: rotation preserves subset of [n]  
  -- 3. rotateSetInBlockK_preserves_card: rotation preserves cardinality
  -- 4. rotateSetInBlockK_preserves_nonBlocky: rotation preserves non-blocky property
  --
  -- The algebraic core (orbit_sum_eq_zero) is proved above. The combinatorial infrastructure
  -- for orbit partitioning requires these additional lemmas.
  --
  -- Proof sketch:
  -- 1. Partition non-blocky sets into orbits under rotation in the smallest split block
  -- 2. Each orbit has size m = d / gcd(d, j) > 1 where j = |blockOffsets|
  -- 3. The sum over each orbit is 0 by orbit_sum_eq_zero
  -- 4. Therefore the total sum is 0
  --
  -- We use a canonical representative approach:
  -- Define canonRep(S) = the element of S's orbit with minimum sum
  -- Then sum over non-blocky = sum over (canonReps × orbits)
  -- Each orbit sum is 0, so total is 0.
  --
  -- For this proof, we need helper lemmas about rotation preserving properties.

  -- The key is that each non-blocky set has a split block, and rotation within

  -- For each S ∈ NonBlocky, let i = smallest split block index
  -- Let j = |blockOffsets d i S|, where 0 < j < d (since block is split)

/-- Blocky subsets correspond to choosing which complete blocks to include,
plus choosing elements from the partial block. The count depends on divisibility.

A blocky k-element subset S of [n] is uniquely determined by:
1. Which complete d-blocks are fully in S (a subset of {0, ..., n/d - 1} of size k/d)
2. Which elements of the partial block are in S (a subset of {0, ..., n%d - 1} of size k%d)

This gives a bijection with pairs from
  (Finset.range (n/d)).powersetCard (k/d) × (Finset.range (n%d)).powersetCard (k%d)
which has cardinality (n/d).choose(k/d) * (n%d).choose(k%d).

When k%d > n%d, no such subsets exist (can't choose k%d elements from n%d available). -/

/-- The sum of contributions from blocky subsets gives the product formula.

For blocky subsets, the contribution factors because:
1. Complete blocks contribute d*d*i + d*(d-1)/2 each, and since ω^d = 1,
   the ω^{d*d*i} part is always 1.
2. The partial block contributes independently.
3. The bijection with (block indices, partial elements) pairs allows factoring. -/

/-! #### The Main Theorem -/

/-- **q-Lucas Theorem** (thm.sign.q-lucas)

Let `K` be a field, `d` a positive integer, and `ω` a primitive `d`-th root of unity in `K`.
For `n, k : ℕ`, write `n = q * d + r` and `k = u * d + v` where `0 ≤ r, v < d`.
Then:
  `[n choose k]_ω = (q choose u) * [r choose v]_ω`

This generalizes the formula for `[n choose k]_{-1}` (which is the case `d = 2`).

**Proof idea:** The proof uses a generalization of sign-reversing involutions to d-cycles.
The key insight is that for a primitive d-th root of unity ω, we have
  ∑_{i=0}^{d-1} ω^i = 0 (when d > 1)
This allows cancellation of terms that don't respect the "block structure" where blocks
are consecutive intervals of size d: {0,...,d-1}, {d,...,2d-1}, etc.

A k-element subset S of {0,...,n-1} can be decomposed into:
1. Which "full blocks" it contains (choosing k/d blocks from n/d available blocks)
2. Which elements of the "partial block" {(n/d)*d, ..., n-1} it contains

For subsets that don't respect the block structure, we can define a d-cycle that
permutes related subsets, and the sum of ω^(exponent) over each cycle is zero.
The remaining terms correspond to "blocky" subsets, giving the product formula.

/-! ### q-Binomial Coefficients at q = -1

We compute `[n choose k]_{-1}` using the q-Lucas theorem with d=2 and ω=-1.
The result depends on the parities of `n` and `k`.

This is Exercise \ref{exe.sign.-1inom} in the source.
-/

/-- A blocky subset of `[n]` (when `n` is even) is a union of blocks `{0,1}, {2,3}, ...`.
Each block is either fully included or fully excluded. -/
def IsBlocky (n : ℕ) (S : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  S ⊆ Finset.range n ∧
  ∀ i : ℕ, 2 * i + 1 < n → ((2 * i ∈ S) ↔ (2 * i + 1 ∈ S))

/-- **q-Binomial at q = -1** (exe.sign.-1inom, eq.sol.sign.-1inom.res)

For `n, k : ℕ`, the q-binomial coefficient `[n choose k]_{-1}` equals:
- `0` if `n` is even and `k` is odd
- `⌊n/2⌋ choose ⌊k/2⌋` otherwise

The proof uses the q-Lucas theorem with d=2 and ω=-1:
`[n choose k]_{-1} = (n/2 choose k/2) * [n%2 choose k%2]_{-1}`

The base cases are:
- `[0 choose 0]_{-1} = 1`
- `[0 choose 1]_{-1} = 0`
- `[1 choose 0]_{-1} = 1`
- `[1 choose 1]_{-1} = 1`

Therefore:
- If `Even n ∧ Odd k`: result is `(n/2 choose k/2) * 0 = 0`
- Otherwise: result is `(n/2 choose k/2) * 1 = (n/2 choose k/2)`
-/

is not in `range 0`, but `∅.card = 0` may not equal `m`. -/
