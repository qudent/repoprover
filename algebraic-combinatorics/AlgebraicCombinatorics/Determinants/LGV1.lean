# The Lindström-Gessel-Viennot Lemma: Part 1

This file formalizes the first part of the Lindström-Gessel-Viennot (LGV) lemma,
covering the basic definitions and counting results for lattice paths.

## Main definitions

* `LGV1.LatticePoint` - A point on the integer lattice ℤ²
* `LGV1.integerLattice` - The integer lattice as a Mathlib `Digraph`
* `LGV1.LatticePath` - A path on the integer lattice using only east (right) and north (up) steps
* `LGV1.LatticePath.stepCount` - The total number of steps in a path
* `LGV1.LatticePath.eastStepCount` - The number of east steps in a path
* `LGV1.PathTuple` - A k-tuple of lattice paths from k source vertices to k target vertices
* `LGV1.PathTuple.isNonIntersecting` - Property that no two paths share a vertex (nipat)
* `LGV1.PathTuple.isIntersecting` - Property that some two paths share a vertex (ipat)
* `LGV1.kVertex` - A k-tuple of lattice points

## Main results

* `latticePath_count` - Number of paths from (a,b) to (c,d) equals C(c+d-a-b, c-a)
  (Proposition prop.lgv.1-paths.ct)
* `lgv_two_paths` - LGV lemma for k=2: determinant equals #nipats to (B,B') - #nipats to (B',B)
  (Proposition prop.lgv.2paths.count)
* `baby_jordan_curve` - Paths from A to B' and A' to B must intersect under NW conditions
  (Proposition prop.lgv.jordan-2)
* `binom_log_concave` - C(n,k)² ≥ C(n,k-1)·C(n,k+1)
  (Corollary cor.lgv.binom-unimod)
* `lgv_k_paths` - General LGV lemma: determinant equals signed sum of nipat counts
  (Proposition prop.lgv.kpaths.count)

## Implementation notes

We formalize lattice paths as lists of steps (east or north), rather than as sequences
of vertices. This makes it easier to work with path concatenation and step counting.

The LGV lemma relates determinants to non-intersecting lattice paths. The key insight
is a sign-reversing involution that cancels intersecting path tuples.

### Relationship with LGV2.lean

This file (LGV1.lean) and LGV2.lean both work with the integer lattice digraph, but
use different representations:

- **LGV1.lean**: Uses Mathlib's `Digraph` type and `LatticePath` (list of steps: east/north)
- **LGV2.lean**: Uses `LGV.SimpleDigraph` (custom structure with irreflexivity) and
  `SimpleDigraph.Path` (list of vertices)

The integer lattice definitions have equivalent adjacency relations:
- LGV1: `integerLattice_adj_iff p q : integerLattice.Adj p q ↔ q = (p.1 + 1, p.2) ∨ q = (p.1, p.2 + 1)`
- LGV2: `integerLattice_arc_iff u v : integerLattice.arc u v ↔ v = (u.1 + 1, u.2) ∨ v = (u.1, u.2 + 1)`

### LatticeStep and LatticePath equivalence

Both files define a `LatticeStep` type for representing east/north steps:
- `LGV1.LatticeStep` (this file)
- `LGV.LatticeStep'` (in LGV2.lean)

These are equivalent types, with explicit conversion functions:
- `latticeStepEquiv : LatticeStep ≃ LGV.LatticeStep'`
- `latticePathToLatticePath' : LatticePath → LGV.LatticePath'`
- `latticePath'ToLatticePath : LGV.LatticePath' → LatticePath`

The duplication exists because LGV1 imports LGV2, preventing LGV2 from referencing
LGV1's definitions. Both definitions are kept compatible with trivial conversions.

LGV2.lean contains the complete weighted LGV lemma proof. This file contains the
counting case infrastructure with lattice-specific path counting results.

## The Integer Lattice (Definition def.lgv.lattice)

The integer lattice ℤ² is an infinite digraph with vertices at integer points
and directed edges (arcs) going east (i,j) → (i+1,j) and north (i,j) → (i,j+1).

This digraph is acyclic and path-finite (only finitely many paths between any two points).

### Formalization of Definition def.lgv.lattice

From the TeX source (AlgebraicCombinatorics/tex/Determinants/LGV1.tex):

> We consider the infinite simple digraph with vertex set ℤ² (so the vertices are pairs
> of integers) and arcs:
>   (i,j) → (i+1,j)  for all (i,j) ∈ ℤ²  [east-steps/right-steps]
>   (i,j) → (i,j+1)  for all (i,j) ∈ ℤ²  [north-steps/up-steps]

The entire digraph is denoted by ℤ² and called the "integer lattice" or "integer grid".

### The Integer Lattice as a Digraph

We formalize the integer lattice as a `Digraph` instance, where an arc exists from
vertex `p` to vertex `q` if and only if `q` is obtained from `p` by either:
- An east step: q = (p.1 + 1, p.2)
- A north step: q = (p.1, p.2 + 1)

## Lattice Steps and Paths

A step on the lattice is either east (right) or north (up).
A lattice path is a sequence of steps starting from a given point.

We formalize paths as lists of steps rather than lists of vertices, which makes
it easier to work with path concatenation and step counting.

    This type is equivalent to `LGV.LatticeStep'` defined in LGV2.lean.
    The equivalence is provided by `latticeStepEquiv : LatticeStep ≃ LGV.LatticeStep'`.

## Counting Paths (Proposition prop.lgv.1-paths.ct)

The number of lattice paths from (a,b) to (c,d) is:
- C(c+d-a-b, c-a) if c+d ≥ a+b (i.e., d-b ≥ a-c)
- 0 if c+d < a+b

This follows from:
- Observation 1: Each path has exactly c+d-a-b steps
- Observation 2: Each path has exactly c-a east steps
- Observation 3: A path with these counts from (a,b) must end at (c,d)

### Bijection between paths and subsets

The key to proving the counting formula is establishing a bijection between:
- Lattice paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with m east steps and n north steps
- Subsets S ⊆ {0, 1, ..., m+n-1} of cardinality m

The bijection: A path corresponds to choosing which m positions (out of m+n total steps)
are east steps. The subset S records exactly those positions.

A k-vertex is a k-tuple of lattice points.
A path tuple from k-vertex A to k-vertex B is a k-tuple of paths where
the i-th path goes from A_i to B_i.

A path tuple is non-intersecting (nipat) if no two paths share a vertex.

## General k Involution Infrastructure

The sign-reversing involution for general k path tuples works as follows:
Given an intersecting path tuple (ipat), we:
1. Find the smallest path index i that contains a "crowded" vertex (shared with another path)
2. Find the first crowded vertex v on path i (by position in the path)
3. Find the largest path index j that contains v (j > i since v is crowded)
4. Exchange the tails of paths i and j at v
5. Compose σ with the transposition (i j) to flip the sign

This maps (σ, ipat) to (σ * swap(i,j), ipat') where:
- sign(σ * swap(i,j)) = -sign(σ) (transposition flips sign)
- ipat' is still intersecting (v is still a crowded point)
- The involution is its own inverse (applying twice returns the original)

Since every ipat has at least one crowded point, the involution has no fixed points.

## The LGV Lemma for Two Paths (Proposition prop.lgv.2paths.count)

For two 2-vertices (A, A') and (B, B'):

det | #paths(A→B)   #paths(A→B')  |
    | #paths(A'→B)  #paths(A'→B') |

= #nipats from (A,A') to (B,B') - #nipats from (A,A') to (B',B)

The proof uses a sign-reversing involution on intersecting path tuples
that exchanges the tails of two intersecting paths.

the first intersection point in path0's vertex list (by index). This ensures that
after swapping tails, the same point is still the first intersection.

/-- Key lemma: The first intersection point is preserved after swapping tails.

    If we swap tails at the first intersection point v, then v is still the first
    intersection point in the new paths. This is because:
    1. The head of path0 (vertices 0..idx) is unchanged
    2. v is at index idx in both the original and new path0's vertices
    3. No earlier vertex in head0 is in path1's vertices (by minimality)

    This lemma is essential for proving that the involution is involutive. -/

/-- The involution is its own inverse.

    After applying the involution twice, we get back the original path tuple.
    The key insight is that:
    1. The first intersection point v is preserved after swapping tails (by firstIntersection_preserved)
    2. The indices idx0 and idx1 are also preserved
    3. Exchanging tails twice returns the original paths (take_append_drop)
    4. toBB' flips twice (!!b = b)

    **Proof strategy:**
    - Use `firstIntersection_preserved` to show v' = v
    - Use `findIdx_beq_eq_firstIntersectionIdx` and `findIdx_beq_newPath1_eq` to show idx0' = idx0 and idx1' = idx1

    Label: prop.lgv.2paths.count

    The proof uses a sign-reversing involution on intersecting path tuples:
    1. Expand the determinant: det(M) = #paths(A→B)·#paths(A'→B') - #paths(A→B')·#paths(A'→B)
    2. By product rule, this equals #pathTuples(→(B,B')) - #pathTuples(→(B',B))
    3. Define signed path tuples with sign +1 for (B,B') and -1 for (B',B)
    4. The involution exchanges tails at the first intersection, flipping the sign

## Baby Jordan Curve Theorem (Proposition prop.lgv.jordan-2)

If A' is weakly northwest of A, and B' is weakly northwest of B,
then any path from A to B' must intersect any path from A' to B.

This means:
- x(A') ≤ x(A) and y(A') ≥ y(A)
- x(B') ≤ x(B) and y(B') ≥ y(B)

Under these conditions, #nipats from (A,A') to (B',B) = 0.

/-- Baby Jordan curve theorem: Under NW conditions, paths must intersect.
    (Proposition prop.lgv.jordan-2)
    Label: prop.lgv.jordan-2

    **Proof strategy** (from tex source, Section sec.details.det.comb):

    The proof is by strong induction on ℓ(p) + ℓ(p'), the sum of path lengths.

    **Base case**: If ℓ(p) + ℓ(p') = 0, then both paths are empty, so A = B' and A' = B.
    From the NW conditions:
    - A'.x ≤ A.x = B'.x ≤ B.x = A'.x, so A'.x = A.x
    - A'.y ≥ A.y = B'.y ≥ B.y = A'.y, so A'.y = A.y
    Thus A = A', and A is a common vertex.

    **Induction step**: Assume the theorem holds for smaller path lengths.
    If A = A', then A is a common vertex and we're done.
    Otherwise, since A' is weakly NW of A and A ≠ A', we have either:
    - Case 1: A'.y > A.y (A' strictly north of A)
    - Case 2: A'.x < A.x (A' strictly west of A)

    In Case 1 (A'.y > A.y):
    - Let P be the next vertex after A on path p
    - If the first step of p is north, then P = (A.x, A.y + 1)
    - Since A'.y > A.y and integers, A'.y ≥ A.y + 1 = P.y
    - So A' is still weakly NW of P
    - The rest of p goes from P to B', and p' goes from A' to B
    - By IH (with smaller path length), these paths intersect
    - Any common vertex of (rest of p) and p' is also on p

    - If the first step of p is east, then P = (A.x + 1, A.y)
    - We need to look at the first step of p' and apply IH appropriately

    Case 2 (A'.x < A.x) is symmetric, looking at the first step of p' instead.

    The key insight is that the "river" created by path p from A to B' must be
    crossed by path p' from A' to B, since A' is northwest of A and B' is
    northwest of B.

## Log-Concavity of Binomial Coefficients (Corollary cor.lgv.binom-unimod)

As an application of the LGV lemma:
C(n,k)² ≥ C(n,k-1) · C(n,k+1)

This follows by choosing appropriate lattice points and applying
Propositions prop.lgv.2paths.count and prop.lgv.jordan-2.
-/

/-- Binomial coefficients are log-concave.
    (Corollary cor.lgv.binom-unimod)
    Label: cor.lgv.binom-unimod

    For k ≥ 1: C(n,k)² ≥ C(n,k-1) · C(n,k+1)

    Note: We require k ≥ 1 because in natural number arithmetic, (0:ℕ) - 1 = 0,
    so C(n, 0-1) = C(n, 0) = 1, and the inequality 1 ≥ n fails for n ≥ 2.
    In the mathematical statement, C(n, -1) = 0, so the k=0 case is trivially true.

    Proof sketch (algebraic): Using the recurrences
    - C(n, k+1) · (k+1) = C(n, k) · (n-k)
    - C(n, k) · k = C(n, k-1) · (n-k+1)
    we can show that C(n,k)² / (C(n,k-1) · C(n,k+1)) = (k+1)(n-k+1) / (k(n-k)).
    This ratio is ≥ 1 because (k+1)(n-k+1) - k(n-k) = n + 1 ≥ 0.

    Combinatorial proof (via LGV): Define lattice points A=(1,0), A'=(0,1),
    B=(k+1, n-k), B'=(k, n-k+1). Then det(path matrix) = #nipats ≥ 0. -/

det(#paths from Aᵢ to Bⱼ)_{i,j} = ∑_{σ ∈ Sₖ} (-1)^σ · #nipats from A to σ(B)

The proof generalizes the k=2 case by using a sign-reversing involution
that picks the first pair of intersecting paths and exchanges their tails.

### Bridge to LGV2.lean

We establish the connection between LGV1's path representation and LGV2's.
The key observation is that both represent the same mathematical objects.

The bridge uses the following chain of equivalences:
1. LGV1.LatticeStep ≃ LGV.LatticeStep' (both are {east, north})
2. LGV1.LatticePath ≃ LGV.LatticePath' (both are lists of steps)
3. LGV1.PathTuple k A B ≃ LGV.LatticePath'Tuple k A B (same structure)
4. LGV.LatticePath'Tuple k A B ≃ LGV.PathTuple integerLattice k A B (via latticePath'TupleEquiv)

The intersection property is preserved at each step, so:
- ipatsFromTo A B ≃ ipatSet integerLattice A B
- numIpatsK A B σ = (ipatFinset ... A (permuteKVertex σ B)).card
-/

    2. Intersecting path tuples cancel via sign-reversing involution
    3. Only non-intersecting path tuples (nipats) survive

    The sign-reversing involution works by:
    - Finding the first crowded point v on the path with smallest index i
    - Finding the largest index j of a path containing v
    - Exchanging tails of paths pᵢ and pⱼ at v
    - Composing σ with the transposition (i,j) to flip the sign

  PROOF STRUCTURE:
  
  The proof reduces to two key lemmas:
  1. partition_lemma: ∏_i numPaths(A_i, B_{σ(i)}) = numNipatsK + numIpatsK
  2. ipat_cancellation: ∑_σ sign(σ) * numIpatsK = 0
  
  From these, the result follows by algebra:
    LHS = ∑_σ sign(σ) * (numNipatsK + numIpatsK)
        = ∑_σ sign(σ) * numNipatsK + ∑_σ sign(σ) * numIpatsK
        = ∑_σ sign(σ) * numNipatsK + 0
        = RHS
  
  PROOF OF partition_lemma:
  Step 1: ∏_i numPaths(A_i, B_{σ(i)}) = (pathTuplesFromTo A (B.permute σ)).ncard
    This is the "product rule": the product of path counts equals the count of path tuples.
    Uses numPaths_eq_card (proved) and the bijection between path tuples and products.
  
  Step 2: pathTuplesFromTo = nipatsFromTo ∪ ipatsFromTo (disjoint union)
    This follows from the definitions: every path tuple is either intersecting or not.
  
  Step 3: ncard of disjoint union = sum of ncards
    Uses Set.ncard_union_eq.
  
  PROOF OF ipat_cancellation:
  This uses a sign-reversing involution on pairs (σ, ipat).
  
  The involution f : (σ, ipat) ↦ (σ ∘ t_{i,j}, ipat') where:
  - i is the smallest index with a path containing a "crowded" point
  - v is the first crowded point on path i
  - j > i is the largest index with a path containing v
  - t_{i,j} is the transposition swapping i and j
  - ipat' has tails of paths i and j exchanged at v
  
  Key properties:
  - sign(σ ∘ t_{i,j}) = -sign(σ) (transposition flips sign)
  - f(f(σ, ipat)) = (σ, ipat) (involution)
  - f has no fixed points (every ipat has a crowded point)
  
  By Finset.sum_involution, the sum cancels to zero.

    PROOF: We use the sign-reversing involution from LGV2.lean.
    
    The key theorem `LGV.sum_signed_ipatFinset_card_eq_zero` proves:
      ∑ σ, sign(σ) * (ipatFinset A (permuteKVertex σ B)).card = 0
    
    We need to show that `numIpatsK A B σ` equals `(ipatFinset A (permuteKVertex σ B)).card`.
    
    This follows because:
    1. The types `LGV1.kVertex k` and `LGV.kVertex (ℤ × ℤ) k` are both `Fin k → ℤ × ℤ`
    2. The permutation functions are the same: `B.permute σ = LGV.permuteKVertex σ B`
    3. The path representations are equivalent via `latticePath'TupleEquiv`
    4. The intersection property is preserved by `latticePath'Tuple_isIntersecting_iff`
    
    The bijection between LGV1's `ipatsFromTo` and LGV2's `ipatFinset` preserves cardinality.

    For k-vertices A = (A₁, ..., Aₖ) and B = (B₁, ..., Bₖ):
    det(#paths from Aᵢ to Bⱼ)_{i,j} = ∑_{σ ∈ Sₖ} (-1)^σ · #nipats from A to σ(B)

    2. Rewriting in terms of path tuples to σ(B)
    3. A sign-reversing involution that cancels intersecting path tuples

## Sign-Reversing Involution (Proof Technique)

The proofs of the LGV lemmas use a sign-reversing involution on intersecting
path tuples. Given an ipat, we:

1. Find the first intersection point v (first crowded point on the path with smallest index)
2. Let i be the smallest index of a path containing v
3. Let j be the largest index of a path containing v (j > i since v is crowded)
4. Exchange the tails (parts after v) of paths pᵢ and pⱼ
5. Compose σ with the transposition (i j)

This involution:
- Maps ipats to ipats
- Reverses sign (since composing with a transposition changes parity)
- Has no fixed points
- Is its own inverse (applying twice returns the original)

By Lemma lem.sign.cancel2, the sum over ipats cancels, leaving only nipats.
