# The Cycle Decomposition

This file formalizes the cycle decomposition (or disjoint cycle decomposition) of a permutation,
as presented in Section "The cycle decomposition" of the source text.

## Main definitions

* `numCyclesTotal`: The total number of cycles including 1-cycles (fixed points).
* `numCycles`: The number of non-trivial cycles (length ≥ 2).
* `cycles`: The set of cycles of a permutation.
* `cycleLengthsPartition`: The partition of n given by cycle lengths.
* `dcdListToPerm`: Convert a list of lists (representing cycles) to a permutation.

## Main results

* `sameCycle_iff_exists_pow`: Two elements belong to the same cycle iff one is a power of the
  permutation applied to the other (Proposition \ref{prop.perm.cycs.same}).
* `exists_dcd`: Every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles
  (Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (a)).
* `dcd_unique_cycleType`: Any two DCDs of the same permutation have the same cycle type
  (Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (b)).
* `canonicalDcd_exists_unique`: For totally ordered sets, there is a unique canonical DCD
  (Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (c)).
* `cycleType_eq_iff_isConj`: Two permutations have the same cycle type iff they are conjugate.
* `sign_eq_neg_one_pow_card_sub_numCycles`: The sign of a permutation equals `(-1)^(n - k)`
  where `k` is the number of cycles (Proposition \ref{prop.perm.cycs.sign}).

### Disjoint Cycle Decomposition (DCD)

Mathlib's `Equiv.Perm.cycleFactorsFinset` provides the set of cycles in the DCD.
The key theorem `cycleFactorsFinset_noncommProd` states that the product of these
cycles equals the original permutation.

Note: This is NOT Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (b), which states that any two DCDs
of the *same* permutation can be obtained from each other by swapping cycles and rotating.
That result is essentially trivial: any DCD of σ yields the same multiset of cycle lengths
(the cycle type), and different DCDs are just reorderings/rotations of the same cycles.

This theorem is a deeper result about when two *different* permutations have the same
cycle structure. -/

/-- Any two DCDs of the same permutation have the same cycle type (as a multiset of lengths).
This captures the essence of Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (b): the cycles of a DCD are
uniquely determined up to swapping and rotation, hence they have the same lengths.

In Mathlib's formalization, there is a canonical DCD (`cycleFactorsFinset`), so this is trivial:
any DCD must produce the same set of cycles as `cycleFactorsFinset`, just possibly listed
in a different order or with different rotations. -/

### Cycles of a permutation (Definition \ref{def.perm.cycs.cycs})

This section formalizes Definition \ref{def.perm.cycs.cycs} from the source text:

**Definition (def.perm.cycs.cycs):** Let X be a finite set. Let σ be a permutation of X.

**(a)** The *cycles* of σ are defined to be the cycles in the DCD of σ
(as defined in Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (a)). This includes 1-cycles, if there
are any in the DCD of σ.

We shall equate a cycle of σ with any of its cyclic rotations; thus, for example,
(3, 1, 4) and (1, 4, 3) shall be regarded as being the same cycle (but (3, 1, 4)
and (3, 4, 1) shall not).

**(b)** The *cycle lengths partition* of σ shall denote the partition of |X| obtained
by writing down the lengths of the cycles of σ in weakly decreasing order.

**Implementation note:** Mathlib's `cycleFactorsFinset` only includes cycles of length ≥ 2
(non-trivial cycles). Fixed points (1-cycles) are not included. This differs from the
textbook which includes 1-cycles. However, for most purposes this is equivalent since
1-cycles act as the identity. The `numCyclesTotal` definition above accounts for this
by adding the number of fixed points.

Regarding cyclic rotations: In Mathlib, cycles are represented as permutations (elements
of `Perm α`), not as lists. Two cycles that are cyclic rotations of each other represent
the *same* permutation, so they are automatically equated. For example, the cycles
`cyc [3, 1, 4]` and `cyc [1, 4, 3]` are equal as permutations by `List.formPerm_rotate`.

`cycleFactorsFinset` only contains non-trivial cycles (length ≥ 2), so fixed points
are not contained in any cycle's support. For fixed points `i = j`, we have
`σ.SameCycle i i` but no cycle containing `i`.

This is an auxiliary characterization connecting cycle membership (in terms of
`cycleFactorsFinset`) to the `SameCycle` relation. The main characterization of

### Canonical DCD (Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (c))

For a totally ordered finite set, there is a unique DCD where:
1. Each cycle starts with its smallest element
2. Cycles appear in decreasing order of first elements

This canonical form is useful for comparing permutations.

For a totally ordered set, the canonical DCD is uniquely determined.
This is Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (c).

The existence follows from taking any DCD and:
1. Rotating each cycle to start with its minimum element
2. Sorting cycles by decreasing first element

The uniqueness follows from Theorem \ref{thm.perm.dcd.main} (b): any two DCDs
differ only by swapping cycles and rotating, so after canonicalization they must agree.

The product condition states that composing all the cycle permutations
(where each list [a₁,...,aₖ] represents cyc_{a₁,...,aₖ}) equals σ.

**Proof outline:**

*Existence:* Construct the canonical DCD as follows:
- For each cycle c in `σ.cycleFactorsFinset`, form `cycleToCanonicalList c`
- For each fixed point x (i.e., x ∉ σ.support), form the singleton list [x]
- Combine these lists and sort by decreasing first element

*Uniqueness:* Suppose we have two valid canonical DCDs. Since both cover all elements
exactly once and represent the same permutation σ:
- The non-singleton lists must correspond to the cycles in `cycleFactorsFinset`
- Each cycle's canonical form is unique (determined by starting from minimum)
- The sorting by decreasing first element is unique

The detailed proof involves showing the constructed DCD satisfies all properties
and that any other valid DCD must equal it. -/
