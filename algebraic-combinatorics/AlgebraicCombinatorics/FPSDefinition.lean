# Formal Power Series: Definition and Basic Properties

This file formalizes the definition of formal power series (FPS) and their basic operations,
following Section "The definition of formal power series" (subsec.gf.defs.fps) of the source.

## Main definitions

* `fpsEquivSeq` (Definition def.fps.fps): The equivalence between formal power series
  `R⟦X⟧` and sequences `ℕ → R`. This formalizes that an FPS is a sequence (a₀, a₁, a₂, ...).

* We use Mathlib's `PowerSeries R` which represents formal power series over a ring `R`.
  This is defined as `MvPowerSeries Unit R`, i.e., sequences `ℕ → R`.

* `PowerSeries.coeff n f` extracts the n-th coefficient of a power series f.
  This corresponds to `[x^n] f` in the source notation.

* `PowerSeries.mk` constructs a power series from a sequence of coefficients.

* `PowerSeries.X` is the indeterminate x = (0, 1, 0, 0, ...).

* `PowerSeries.C` embeds constants into power series as (a, 0, 0, ...).

## Main results

* `PowerSeries` forms a commutative ring (Theorem thm.fps.ring (a))
* `PowerSeries` is a module over the base ring (Theorem thm.fps.ring (b))
* Scaling by λ equals multiplication by C λ (Theorem thm.fps.ring (d))
* Coefficient extraction is additive and compatible with multiplication
* Multiplication by x shifts coefficients: X * (a₀, a₁, ...) = (0, a₀, a₁, ...) (Lemma lem.fps.xa)
* `x^k` has the form (0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0, 0, ...) with k zeros (Proposition prop.fps.xk)
* Any FPS can be written as ∑ aₙ xⁿ (Corollary cor.fps.sumakxk)

## References

* Source: FPSDefinition.tex, subsec.gf.defs.fps

## Implementation notes

Mathlib already provides `PowerSeries R` with all the ring structure and basic operations.
This file provides additional lemmas and connects Mathlib's API to the textbook presentation.

For summable families of FPS, we use Mathlib's topological structure on power series
(`PowerSeries.WithPiTopology`), where a family is summable when for each coefficient index,
all but finitely many terms have that coefficient equal to zero.

## Definition of FPS (Definition def.fps.fps)

**Definition def.fps.fps**: A formal power series (FPS) in one indeterminate over K
is a sequence (a₀, a₁, a₂, ...) = (aₙ)_{n ∈ ℕ} ∈ K^ℕ of elements of K.

In Mathlib, this is represented by `PowerSeries R` (notation: `R⟦X⟧`).
The type `PowerSeries R` is defined as `MvPowerSeries Unit R`, which is
definitionally `(Unit →₀ ℕ) → R`. Since `Unit →₀ ℕ` is equivalent to `ℕ`,
this is essentially `ℕ → R`.

The constructor `PowerSeries.mk : (ℕ → R) → R⟦X⟧` builds an FPS from a sequence.
The extractor `PowerSeries.coeff n : R⟦X⟧ → R` retrieves the n-th coefficient.

/-- **Definition def.fps.fps**: The equivalence between formal power series `R⟦X⟧`
    and sequences `ℕ → R`.

    This formalizes Definition def.fps.fps from the source: a formal power series
    is a sequence (a₀, a₁, a₂, ...) of elements of R.

(b) An R-module
(c) Scaling commutes with multiplication: λ(fg) = (λf)g = f(λg)

Note: Mathlib already provides these structures on `PowerSeries R`:
- `CommRing R⟦X⟧` instance exists in `Mathlib.RingTheory.PowerSeries.Basic`

## Summable Families of FPS (Definition def.fps.summable)

A family (fᵢ)_{i ∈ I} of FPS is summable (or entrywise essentially finite) if
for each n ∈ ℕ, all but finitely many i ∈ I satisfy [x^n] fᵢ = 0.

In this case, the sum ∑_{i ∈ I} fᵢ is defined as the FPS with
[x^n](∑_{i ∈ I} fᵢ) = ∑_{i ∈ I} [x^n] fᵢ (an essentially finite sum).

In Mathlib, this is captured by the topology on power series where
convergence means eventual stability of each coefficient.
See `PowerSeries.WithPiTopology` for details.

## Essentially Finite Sums (Definition def.infsum.essfin)

A family (aᵢ)_{i ∈ I} of ring elements is essentially finite if
all but finitely many i satisfy aᵢ = 0.

Note: This is equivalent to `(Function.support f).Finite` in Mathlib.

### Part (a): Definition of essentially finite families

A family (aᵢ)_{i ∈ I} ∈ K^I of elements of K is essentially finite if all but finitely
many i ∈ I satisfy aᵢ = 0 (in other words, if the set {i ∈ I | aᵢ ≠ 0} is finite).

### Part (b): Sum of essentially finite families

Let (aᵢ)_{i ∈ I} ∈ K^I be an essentially finite family of elements of K.
Then, the infinite sum ∑_{i ∈ I} aᵢ is defined to equal the finite sum ∑_{i ∈ I, aᵢ ≠ 0} aᵢ.
Such an infinite sum is said to be essentially finite.

### Sum of an essentially finite family (Definition def.infsum.essfin (b))

For an essentially finite family (aᵢ)_{i ∈ I}, the infinite sum ∑_{i ∈ I} aᵢ
is defined to equal the finite sum ∑_{i ∈ I, aᵢ ≠ 0} aᵢ.

We connect this to Mathlib's `Finsupp.sum` infrastructure.

## Rules for Summable Sums (Proposition prop.fps.summable-sums-rule)

Sums of summable families of FPS satisfy the usual rules for sums:
- Breaking-apart rule: if S = X ∪ Y (disjoint), then ∑_{i ∈ S} fᵢ = ∑_{i ∈ X} fᵢ + ∑_{i ∈ Y} fᵢ
- Fubini rule: ∑_{i ∈ I} ∑_{j ∈ J} fᵢⱼ = ∑_{(i,j) ∈ I×J} fᵢⱼ = ∑_{j ∈ J} ∑_{i ∈ I} fᵢⱼ
  (when the family (fᵢⱼ)_{(i,j) ∈ I×J} is summable)

These properties follow from the corresponding properties of essentially finite sums
applied coefficient-wise.

/-- The Fubini rule for summable FPS families: interchange of summation is valid
    when the family indexed by the product is summable.
    (Proposition prop.fps.summable-sums-rule, discrete Fubini rule)

    Note: The actual sum computation requires Mathlib's topological sum machinery.

For a, b ∈ ℂ and n ∈ ℕ: C(a+b, n) = ∑_{k=0}^n C(a,k) C(b, n-k)

The proof uses the polynomial identity trick: both sides are polynomials in a and b
