# Infinite Products of Formal Power Series

This file formalizes the theory of infinite products of formal power series (FPS),
following the treatment in the source material (Section `sec.gf.prod`).

## Relationship with `InfiniteProducts1.lean`

This file (`InfiniteProducts.lean`) provides the primary API in the `PowerSeries` namespace.
The file `InfiniteProducts1.lean` provides an alternative formalization in the `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS`
namespace with **definitionally equivalent** definitions:

* `PowerSeries.Multipliable a` = `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.Multipliable a`
* `PowerSeries.tprod a h` = `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.infprod a h`
* `PowerSeries.DeterminesCoeffInProd a M n` = `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.DeterminesCoeff a n M` (argument order)
* `PowerSeries.IsXnApproximator a M n` = `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.IsXnApproximator a n M` (argument order)

The `PowerSeries` namespace versions are canonical and recommended for new code.

## Main Definitions

* `PowerSeries.DeterminesCoeffInProd`: A finite subset `M` determines the `x^n`-coefficient
  in the product of a family if adding more factors doesn't change that coefficient.
* `PowerSeries.CoeffFinitelyDeterminedInProd`: The `x^n`-coefficient is finitely determined
  if some finite subset determines it.
* `PowerSeries.Multipliable`: A family of FPS is multipliable if all coefficients in its
  product are finitely determined.
* `PowerSeries.tprod`: The infinite product of a multipliable family.
* `PowerSeries.IsXnApproximator`: A finite subset that determines the first `n+1` coefficients.

## Main Results

* `PowerSeries.multipliable_coeff_eq_of_determines`: The infinite product is well-defined.
* `PowerSeries.tprod_coeff`: The coefficient of the infinite product equals the coefficient
  of any determining finite partial product.
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_one_add_of_summable`: If `(f_i)` is summable, then `(1 + f_i)` is multipliable.
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_of_finite_ne_one`: If all but finitely many entries equal 1,
  the family is multipliable.
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_of_union`: Products can be split into subproducts.
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_mul`: Products of multipliable families are multipliable.
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_div`: Quotients of multipliable families (with invertible denominators).
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_subfamily`: Subfamilies of multipliable families of invertible FPS.
* `PowerSeries.multipliable_reindex`: Reindexing preserves multipliability.
* `PowerSeries.tprod_fubini`: Fubini rule for infinite products (I × J → I then J).
* `PowerSeries.tprod_fubini_J`: Fubini rule for infinite products (I × J → J then I).
* `PowerSeries.fubini_prod_invertible`: Fubini rule showing both row/column families are multipliable.

### Motivating Example: Binary Representation

The product `∏_{i ∈ ℕ} (1 + x^{2^i})` equals `1/(1-x)` in `R[[x]]`.
This relates to the unique binary representation of natural numbers.

2. Let M = U ∪ V
3. Show M determines the x^n coefficient for (a_i * b_i)
4. Use the fact that if two pairs of FPS agree up to degree n,
   their products also agree up to degree n -/

### Breaking Products into Subproducts

Proposition \ref{prop.fps.prods-mulable-rules.SW1}
-/

/-- The family of subproducts indexed by fibers is multipliable.
(Label: prop.fps.prods-mulable-rules.SW1)

This theorem proves that if a family `(a_s)_{s ∈ S}` of power series is multipliable,
and each fiber `{s : f s = w}` gives a multipliable subfamily, then the family of
fiber products `(tprod_{s : f s = w} a_s)_{w ∈ W}` is also multipliable.

**Note:** The TeX source proof uses Lemma lem.fps.prods-mulable-subfams-appr which
requires invertibility. This Lean proof uses a different approach that avoids the
invertibility assumption: instead of showing each fiber's tprod is x^n-equivalent to 1
(which requires invertibility to "cancel" other fibers), we directly relate the outer
product to the full product via unions of fiber approximators. -/

/-- A multipliable product can be broken into subproducts indexed by a map.
(Label: prop.fps.prods-mulable-rules.SW1)

This theorem states that if `(a_s)_{s ∈ S}` is a multipliable family of FPS, then the infinite
product can be computed by first grouping elements by their image under `f : S → W`, computing
the infinite product within each fiber, and then taking the infinite product of those results.

**Proof approach:** Rather than trying to show that `U ∩ fiber(w)` determines the coefficient
in the fiber product (which requires invertibility to "cancel" other fibers), we use proper
approximators `M_w` for each fiber from `ha_fibers`, and relate everything through the full
product approximator. This approach follows `multipliable_prod_fibers`. -/

/-- Full Fubini rule: products over `I × J` can be computed as iterated products in either order.

This combines both directions of the Fubini rule:
- `∏_{(i,j) ∈ I × J} a_{(i,j)} = ∏_{i ∈ I} ∏_{j ∈ J} a_{(i,j)}`
- `∏_{(i,j) ∈ I × J} a_{(i,j)} = ∏_{j ∈ J} ∏_{i ∈ I} a_{(i,j)}`

### Approximator Properties in terms of x^n-equivalence

Proposition \ref{prop.fps.infprod-approx-xneq}

These are the same results as above, but stated using the `xnEquiv` relation
(which says two FPS agree on coefficients 0 through n).

Note: The `xnEquiv` definition and basic lemmas (`xnEquiv_refl`, `xnEquiv_symm`, `xnEquiv_trans`)
are imported from `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.Limits`.

/-- If `M` is an `x^n`-approximator, then any finite superset `J` gives an x^n-equivalent
finite product.
(Label: prop.fps.infprod-approx-xneq part (a))

This is the x^n-equivalence form of the approximator property: for any finite
`J ⊇ M`, we have `∏_{i∈J} a_i ≡[x^n] ∏_{i∈M} a_i`. -/
theorem xn_approximator_superset_xnEquiv {a : I → PowerSeries R} {M : Finset I} {n : ℕ}

/-- For a multipliable family, the infinite product is x^n-equivalent to the product
over any x^n-approximator.
(Label: prop.fps.infprod-approx-xneq part (b))

This is the x^n-equivalence form: if `M` is an x^n-approximator for a multipliable
family `(a_i)_{i∈I}`, then `∏_{i∈I} a_i ≡[x^n] ∏_{i∈M} a_i`. -/
