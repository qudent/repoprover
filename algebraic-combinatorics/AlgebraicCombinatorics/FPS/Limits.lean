# Limits of Formal Power Series

This file formalizes the notion of coefficientwise limits of formal power series,
following Section 7.5 of Loehr's "Bijective Combinatorics".

## Main Definitions

* `Seq.StabilizesTo`: A sequence `(a_i)_{i ∈ ℕ}` stabilizes to `a` if there exists `N`
  such that for all `i ≥ N`, we have `a_i = a`. (Definition 7.5.1)
* `PowerSeries.CoeffStabilizesTo`: A sequence of FPSs `(f_i)` coefficientwise stabilizes
  to `f` if for each `n ∈ ℕ`, the sequence of `n`-th coefficients stabilizes.
  (Definition 7.5.2)

## Main Results

* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_of_forall_coeff_stabilizes`: If each coefficient sequence
  stabilizes, then the FPS sequence coefficientwise stabilizes. (Theorem 7.5.3)
* `PowerSeries.exists_xnEquiv_of_coeffStabilizesTo`: If `f_i → f`, then for each `n`,
  eventually `f_i ≡ f (mod x^{n+1})`. (Lemma 7.5.4)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_add`: Limits respect addition. (Proposition 7.5.5)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_mul`: Limits respect multiplication. (Proposition 7.5.5)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_div`: Limits respect division. (Proposition 7.5.6)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_comp`: Limits respect composition. (Proposition 7.5.7)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_derivative`: Limits respect derivatives. (Proposition 7.5.8)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_sum`: Infinite sum is limit of partial sums. (Theorem 7.5.9)
* `PowerSeries.coeffStabilizesTo_prod`: Infinite product is limit of partial products.
  (Theorem 7.5.10)
* `PowerSeries.fps_eq_limit_of_polynomials`: Each FPS is a limit of polynomials.
  (Corollary 7.5.11)

## Relationship with InfiniteProducts.lean

This file also defines `IsMultipliable` and `tprod'` for ℕ-indexed sequences of FPS.
These are **more restrictive** than the general `PowerSeries.Multipliable` and
`PowerSeries.tprod` in `InfiniteProducts.lean`:

* `IsMultipliable f` requires: (1) all constant terms equal 1, AND (2) eventually
  all terms are 1 + O(x^{n+1}) for each n.
* `PowerSeries.Multipliable a` only requires that each coefficient is finitely determined.

The `IsMultipliable`/`tprod'` definitions are used specifically for limits of partial
products (where the index is ℕ and we consider products `∏_{i=0}^{N} f_i`).
For general infinite products over arbitrary index types, use the definitions in
`InfiniteProducts.lean`.

/-! ### x^n-Equivalence Properties

The canonical definition of x^n-equivalence (`XnEquiv`) and its properties are in
`AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.XnEquivalence`. The notation `f ≡[x^n] g` is defined there.

This section provides:
1. `xnEquiv` as an alias for `XnEquiv` (for use in this file's context)
2. `xnEquiv_*` lemmas as convenience aliases with underscore naming convention
3. Additional lemmas not in `XnEquivalence.lean` (e.g., `xnEquiv_subst`, `xnEquiv_invOfUnit`)

Note: `xnEquiv_refl` has `@[refl]` for use with the `refl` tactic. -/

This follows from the summability condition: only finitely many terms have
nonzero `n`-th coefficient, so once the partial sum includes all of these,
it stabilizes. -/
