# Integer Compositions

This file formalizes integer compositions and weak compositions, following
Section sec.fps.intcomps of the source text.

## Main definitions

* `Composition` - A composition as a `List ℕ+` (tuple of positive integers)
* `Composition.append` - Concatenation of two compositions
* `Composition.ofSize n` - The subtype of compositions with size `n`
* `Composition.ofSizeIntoParts n k` - The subtype of compositions with size `n` and length `k`
* `WeakComposition` - A weak composition as a `List ℕ` (tuple of nonnegative integers)
* `WeakComposition.ofSizeIntoParts n k` - Weak compositions of `n` into `k` parts
* `BoundedWeakComposition n k p` - Weak compositions with entries in `{0, 1, ..., p-1}`

## Main results

* `Composition.card_ofSizeIntoParts_pos` - The number of compositions of `n` into `k` parts
  is `Nat.choose (n-1) (k-1)` for `n > 0` and `k > 0` (Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-comps-n-k)
* `Composition.card_ofSizeIntoParts_zero` - The number of compositions of `0` into `k` parts
  is `1` if `k = 0`, else `0`
* `Composition.card_ofSizeIntoParts_k_zero` - The number of compositions of `n > 0` into
  `0` parts is `0`
* `Composition.card_ofSize` - The number of compositions of `n` is `2^(n-1)` for `n > 0`
  (Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-comps-n)
* `WeakComposition.card_ofSizeIntoParts` - The number of weak compositions of `n` into `k` parts
  is `Nat.choose (n+k-1) n` (Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wcomps-n-k)
* `BoundedWeakComposition.card` - The number of weak compositions with bounded entries
  (Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k)
* `binom_sum_identity` - An identity involving binomial coefficients
  (Proposition prop.fps.comps.num-w2comps-n-k-id)

## Implementation notes

This file defines `Composition` as `List ℕ+`, which is an alternative representation to
Mathlib's `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Enumerative.Composition` which uses `Composition n` as a
structure with `blocks : List ℕ` and proofs of positivity and sum. Both representations
are equivalent; we use `List ℕ+` here to follow the source text's presentation more directly.

/-! ### Counting Compositions via Mathlib

We prove the main counting theorem using Mathlib's `Composition n` type, which has
a well-developed API including an equivalence with subsets of `Fin (n-1)`.

The key insight is that compositions of `n` into `k` parts correspond bijectively
to `(k-1)`-element subsets of `{1, ..., n-1}`, giving the count `C(n-1, k-1)`.

/--
Key lemma: for `n > 0`, the cardinality of the finset associated to a composition
equals the length minus 1.

This follows from the structure of the `compositionAsSetEquiv`: it extracts the
"interior" boundary points of a composition (those between 0 and n), and a
composition of length k has exactly k-1 such interior points.

**Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-comps-n-k**:
For `n > 0` and `k > 0`, the number of compositions of `n` into `k` parts is `Nat.choose (n-1) (k-1)`.

Note: The source text states this as `C(n-1, n-k) = C(n-1, k-1)` for `n > 0`, but
`C(n-1, n-k)` uses integer binomial coefficients where `C(-1, -k) = 0` for `k > 0`.
In Lean's `Nat.choose` with truncating subtraction, `Nat.choose (0-1) (0-k) = Nat.choose 0 0 = 1`,
which is incorrect for the case `n = 0, k > 0`. Additionally, when `n > 0` and `k = 0`,
the formula `Nat.choose (n-1) (k-1) = Nat.choose (n-1) 0 = 1`, but there are no compositions
of `n > 0` into 0 parts (the count should be 0).

Therefore, we require both `n > 0` and `k > 0`, and handle edge cases separately.

The number of weak compositions of `n` into `k` parts is `Nat.choose (n+k-1) n`.

The proof uses the "stars and bars" technique: weak compositions of `n` into `k` parts
are in bijection with multisets of size `n` from an alphabet of size `k` (i.e., `Sym (Fin k) n`),
which are counted by `Nat.choose (n+k-1) n`.

/-! #### Generating Function Approach

The proof of Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k uses generating functions.
The generating function for bounded weak compositions is `W_{k,p} = (∑_{i=0}^{p-1} x^i)^k`,
which equals `((1-x^p)/(1-x))^k = (1-x^p)^k * (1-x)^{-k}`.

Using binomial expansions:
- `(1-x^p)^k = ∑_{j=0}^k (-1)^j C(k,j) x^{pj}`
- `(1-x)^{-k} = ∑_{m≥0} C(m+k-1, m) x^m` (via `PowerSeries.invOneSubPow`)

Convolving these gives the formula.

Key lemma: the coefficient of `x^n` in the generating function equals the count.

This is the standard fact that `[x^n](∑_{i<p} x^i)^k` counts k-tuples in `{0,...,p-1}^k` summing to `n`.
The proof uses the product rule for power series coefficients.

The main coefficient extraction using the generating function approach.

Using `genFun k p = (1 - X^p)^k * (1-X)^{-k}` and the convolution formula:
- `(1-X^p)^k` has coefficient `(-1)^j C(k,j)` at `x^{pj}` for `j ≤ k`, else `0`
- `(1-X)^{-k}` has coefficient `C(k-1+m, k-1)` at `x^m` for `k > 0`

Convolving gives: `[x^n] = ∑_{pj ≤ n} (-1)^j C(k,j) * C(k-1+(n-pj), k-1)`

**Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k**:
The number of `k`-tuples `(α₁, α₂, ..., αₖ) ∈ {0, 1, ..., p-1}^k`
satisfying `α₁ + α₂ + ... + αₖ = n` is
`∑_{j : p*j ≤ n} (-1)^j * C(k,j) * C(n - p*j + k - 1, n - p*j)`.

Note: The sum is restricted to `j` with `p * j ≤ n` because when `p * j > n`,
the mathematical binomial coefficient `C(n - p*j + k - 1, n - p*j)` should be 0
(as there are no compositions with negative sum), but `Nat.choose` with truncating
subtraction would give a non-zero value.

## Proof Strategy

The proof uses generating functions. The generating function for bounded weak compositions
is `W_{k,p} = (∑_{i=0}^{p-1} x^i)^k`, which equals `((1-x^p)/(1-x))^k = (1-x^p)^k * (1-x)^{-k}`.

Using binomial expansions:
- `(1-x^p)^k = ∑_{j=0}^k (-1)^j C(k,j) x^{pj}`
- `(1-x)^{-k} = ∑_{m≥0} C(m+k-1, m) x^m`

Convolving these gives the formula.

**Proposition prop.fps.comps.num-w2comps-n-k-id**:
For `n, k ∈ ℕ`, we have
`C(k, n) = ∑_{j : 2*j ≤ n} (-1)^j * C(k,j) * C(n - 2j + k - 1, n - 2j)`.

This identity arises from the special case `p = 2` of Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k,
where we count binary strings (k-tuples of 0s and 1s) with exactly n ones.

## Proof Strategy

The proof uses generating functions:
1. Binary k-strings with n ones are counted by `C(k, n)` (choosing which n positions are 1s)
2. By Theorem thm.fps.comps.num-wpcomps-n-k with `p = 2`, the count also equals the sum formula
3. The generating function identity `(1+X)^k = (1-X²)^k / (1-X)^k` underlies this:
   - `(1-X²) = (1-X)(1+X)`, so `(1-X²)^k / (1-X)^k = (1+X)^k`
   - Coefficient of X^n in `(1+X)^k` is `C(k, n)`
   - Coefficient of X^n in `(1-X²)^k * (1-X)^{-k}` gives the sum formula via convolution

Note: The sum is restricted to `j` with `2 * j ≤ n` because when `2j > n`, the term
contributes 0 (no valid compositions exist with negative sum).
