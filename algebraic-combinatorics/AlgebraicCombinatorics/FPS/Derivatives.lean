# Derivatives of Formal Power Series

This file formalizes the theory of derivatives of formal power series (FPS) from
`AlgebraicCombinatorics/tex/FPS/Derivatives.tex`.

## Main Results

The derivative of a formal power series `f = ∑ fₙ xⁿ` is defined as `f' = ∑ n · fₙ · x^(n-1)`.

Mathlib already provides `PowerSeries.derivative` as a derivation on `R⟦X⟧`. We document
the correspondence with the textbook theorems and provide any additional results.

### Derivative Rules (Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules)

* **(a)** `(f + g)' = f' + g'` — `derivative_add`
* **(b)** Summable families: `(∑ fᵢ)' = ∑ fᵢ'` — `derivative_sum`, `derivative_summableFPSSum`
* **(c)** `(c · f)' = c · f'` — `derivative_smul`, `derivative_C_mul`
* **(d)** `(f · g)' = f' · g + f · g'` — `derivative_mul` (Leibniz rule)
* **(e)** `(f / g)' = (f' · g - f · g') / g²` — `derivative_div` (quotient rule)
* **(f)** `(g^n)' = n · g^(n-1) · g'` — `derivative_pow'` (power rule)
* **(g)** `(f ∘ g)' = (f' ∘ g) · g'` — `derivative_comp` (chain rule)
* **(h)** If `f' = g'`, then `f - g` is constant — `derivative_eq_imp_diff_const`

## Definition of Derivative

The derivative of a formal power series is already defined in Mathlib as
`PowerSeries.derivative : Derivation R R⟦X⟧ R⟦X⟧`.

For `f = ∑ fₙ xⁿ`, we have `f' = ∑ (n+1) · f_{n+1} · xⁿ`, or equivalently,
the n-th coefficient of `f'` is `(n+1) · f_{n+1}`.

This matches Definition def.fps.deriv from the source.

### Definition def.fps.deriv

For `f = ∑ fₙ xⁿ`, the textbook defines `f' := ∑_{n>0} n · fₙ · x^{n-1}`.

Reindexing with m = n-1 (so n = m+1), this becomes:
`f' = ∑_{m≥0} (m+1) · f_{m+1} · x^m`

This is exactly `PowerSeries.derivativeFun` from Mathlib, which defines:
`derivativeFun f := mk (fun n => coeff (n + 1) f * (n + 1))`

The derivative is then packaged as a `Derivation R R⟦X⟧ R⟦X⟧`.
-/

/-- **Definition def.fps.deriv**: The n-th coefficient of the derivative of f
equals (n+1) times the (n+1)-th coefficient of f.

This is `PowerSeries.coeff_derivative` in Mathlib. -/

/-- **Definition def.fps.deriv**: The derivative expressed in terms of `mk`.

For `f = ∑ fₙ xⁿ`, the textbook defines `f' := ∑_{n>0} n · fₙ · x^{n-1}`.
Reindexing gives `f' = mk (fun m => (m+1) * f_{m+1})`. -/

We document the correspondence between the textbook theorems and Mathlib.

/-!
### Part (a): Additivity

`(f + g)' = f' + g'`

This is automatic since `derivative` is a `Derivation`, hence an additive map.
-/

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (a)**: Derivative is additive. -/
theorem derivative_add (f g : R⟦X⟧) : d⁄dX R (f + g) = d⁄dX R f + d⁄dX R g :=

theorem derivative_sub {R : Type*} [CommRing R] (f g : R⟦X⟧) :
    d⁄dX R (f - g) = d⁄dX R f - d⁄dX R g :=
  map_sub (d⁄dX R) f g

/-!
### Part (b): Summable Families

If `(fᵢ)_{i ∈ I}` is a summable family of FPSs, then `(∑ fᵢ)' = ∑ fᵢ'`.

We first state it for finite sums (which follows from additivity), then for
infinite summable families (where summability means that for each coefficient
index, only finitely many family members have nonzero coefficient).
-/

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (b)** (finite version):
Derivative commutes with finite sums. -/
theorem derivative_sum {ι : Type*} (s : Finset ι) (f : ι → R⟦X⟧) :
    d⁄dX R (∑ i ∈ s, f i) = ∑ i ∈ s, d⁄dX R (f i) :=
  map_sum (d⁄dX R) f s

/-- If (fᵢ) is a summable family, then (fᵢ') is also summable. -/

Derivative commutes with infinite summable sums.

If (fᵢ)_{i ∈ I} is a summable family of FPSs, then (fᵢ')_{i ∈ I} is summable
and (∑ fᵢ)' = ∑ fᵢ'. -/

### Part (c): Scalar Multiplication

`(c · f)' = c · f'`

This is automatic since `derivative` is an `R`-linear map.
-/

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (c)**: Derivative commutes with scalar multiplication. -/
theorem derivative_smul (c : R) (f : R⟦X⟧) : d⁄dX R (c • f) = c • d⁄dX R f :=
  (d⁄dX R).map_smul c f

/-- Variant with `C c * f` instead of `c • f`. -/

  rw [← PowerSeries.smul_eq_C_mul, ← PowerSeries.smul_eq_C_mul, derivative_smul]

/-!
### Part (d): Leibniz Rule (Product Rule)

`(f · g)' = f' · g + f · g'`

This is the defining property of a derivation.
-/

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (d)**: Leibniz rule for power series. -/
theorem derivative_mul (f g : R⟦X⟧) :
    d⁄dX R (f * g) = d⁄dX R f * g + f * d⁄dX R g := by
  rw [Derivation.leibniz, smul_eq_mul, smul_eq_mul]
  ring

/-!
### Part (e): Quotient Rule

`(f / g)' = (f' · g - f · g') / g²` for invertible `g`.

In Mathlib, this is expressed using `PowerSeries.derivative_inv'` for fields,
or `PowerSeries.derivative_inv` for units.
-/

variable {K : Type*} [Field K]

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (e)**: Quotient rule for power series.

Note: In Mathlib, this is stated as `(f⁻¹)' = -f⁻¹² · f'`.
The full quotient rule follows from combining this with Leibniz. -/
theorem derivative_div (f g : K⟦X⟧) (hg : constantCoeff g ≠ 0) :
    d⁄dX K (f * g⁻¹) = (d⁄dX K f * g - f * d⁄dX K g) * g⁻¹ ^ 2 := by
  have hg_unit : g * g⁻¹ = 1 := g.mul_inv_cancel hg
  have hg_unit' : g⁻¹ * g = 1 := g.inv_mul_cancel hg
  rw [derivative_mul, derivative_inv']
  have h1 : d⁄dX K f * g⁻¹ + f * (-(g⁻¹ ^ 2) * d⁄dX K g)
          = d⁄dX K f * g⁻¹ - f * g⁻¹ ^ 2 * d⁄dX K g := by ring
  rw [h1]
  have h2 : d⁄dX K f * g⁻¹ = d⁄dX K f * g⁻¹ ^ 2 * g := by
    rw [sq, mul_assoc, mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc g⁻¹ g⁻¹ g]
    rw [mul_assoc g⁻¹, hg_unit', mul_one]
  rw [h2]
  ring

/-!
### Part (f): Power Rule

`(g^n)' = n · g^(n-1) · g'`

This is `PowerSeries.derivative_pow` in Mathlib.
-/

variable {A : Type*} [CommRing A]

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (f)**: Power rule for power series. -/
theorem derivative_pow' (g : A⟦X⟧) (n : ℕ) :
    d⁄dX A (g ^ n) = n * g ^ (n - 1) * d⁄dX A g :=
  PowerSeries.derivative_pow A g n

/-!
### Part (g): Chain Rule

`(f ∘ g)' = (f' ∘ g) · g'` when composition is defined.

In Mathlib, composition is `PowerSeries.subst`, and this is `PowerSeries.derivative_subst`.
The condition for substitution is that `g` has nilpotent constant term (which includes
the case when `[x⁰]g = 0`).
-/

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (g)**: Chain rule for power series.

This holds when `g` has nilpotent constant coefficient (in particular when `[x⁰]g = 0`). -/
theorem derivative_comp (f g : A⟦X⟧) (hg : HasSubst g) :
    d⁄dX A (f.subst g) = (d⁄dX A f).subst g * d⁄dX A g :=
  @PowerSeries.derivative_subst A _ f g hg

/-!
### Part (h): Uniqueness of Antiderivatives

If `f' = g'` and `K` is a ℚ-algebra, then `f - g` is constant.

In Mathlib, this is `PowerSeries.derivative.ext` (with the converse direction:
if derivatives and constant terms match, then the series are equal).
-/

/-- **Theorem thm.fps.deriv.rules (h)**: Two power series with equal derivatives
differ by a constant.

Note: Mathlib states this as: if `f' = g'` and `f₀ = g₀`, then `f = g`.
We state the equivalent: if `f' = g'`, then `f - g` has zero derivative,
hence is constant (all higher coefficients are zero). -/
theorem derivative_eq_imp_diff_const {R : Type*} [CommRing R] [IsAddTorsionFree R]
    {f g : R⟦X⟧} (h : d⁄dX R f = d⁄dX R g) :
    ∀ n : ℕ, n ≠ 0 → PowerSeries.coeff n (f - g) = 0 := by

/-- Equivalent formulation: if two power series have equal derivatives and equal
constant terms, they are equal. This is `PowerSeries.derivative.ext` in Mathlib. -/
