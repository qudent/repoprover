# Laurent Power Series

This file formalizes properties of Laurent polynomials and Laurent power series,
following Section `\ref{sec.details.gf.laure}` of the source material.

## Overview

Laurent polynomials are formal sums `∑_{i ∈ ℤ} aᵢ xⁱ` where only finitely many coefficients
are nonzero. Laurent power series are formal sums where the sequence of negative-indexed
coefficients is essentially finite (i.e., only finitely many negative powers appear).

In Mathlib:
- Laurent polynomials are `LaurentPolynomial R` (notation `R[T;T⁻¹]`), implemented as
  `AddMonoidAlgebra R ℤ`
- Laurent series are `LaurentSeries R` (notation `R⸨X⸩`), implemented as `HahnSeries ℤ R`

## Main Results

### Laurent Polynomials (Theorem thm.fps.laure.laupol-ring)
- `LaurentPolynomial` forms a commutative `K`-algebra with `x` invertible
- Multiplication by `x` shifts coefficients: `x · a = (aₙ₋₁)_{n∈ℤ}` (Lemma lem.fps.laure.xa)
- For each `k ∈ ℤ`, we have `xᵏ = (δᵢ,ₖ)_{i∈ℤ}` (Proposition prop.fps.laure.xk)
- Every Laurent polynomial can be written as `∑ aᵢ xⁱ` (`eq_sum_T`)

### Laurent Series (Theorem thm.fps.laure.lauser-ring)
- `LaurentSeries` forms a commutative `K`-algebra with `x` invertible
- The product of two Laurent series is again a Laurent series (closure under multiplication)
- Every Laurent series can be written as `∑_{i∈ℤ} aᵢ xⁱ` (Proposition prop.fps.laure.a=sumaixi)

## Section: Laurent Polynomials

A Laurent polynomial over a commutative ring `K` is a formal sum `∑_{i ∈ ℤ} aᵢ xⁱ`
where only finitely many coefficients `aᵢ` are nonzero.

In Mathlib, `LaurentPolynomial R` is defined as `AddMonoidAlgebra R ℤ`, i.e., finitely
supported functions `ℤ →₀ R`. The variable is denoted `T` to distinguish from polynomials.

## Definition: Laurent Polynomials (def.fps.laure.laupol)

This section formalizes Definition \ref{def.fps.laure.laupol} from the source material.

A Laurent polynomial over K is an essentially finite family (aₙ)_{n∈ℤ}, i.e., a function
ℤ → K with finite support. The set K[x^±] of all Laurent polynomials forms a K-submodule
of the doubly infinite power series K[[x^±]].

Multiplication is defined by convolution:
  (a · b)_n = ∑_{i∈ℤ} aᵢ · b_{n-i}

The indeterminate x is defined as x = (δ_{i,1})_{i∈ℤ}, i.e., the sequence with 1 at
position 1 and 0 elsewhere.

In Mathlib, Laurent polynomials are represented as `LaurentPolynomial K = AddMonoidAlgebra K ℤ`,
which is exactly `ℤ →₀ K` (finitely supported functions from ℤ to K). This matches the
definition of essentially finite families.

then so is the corresponding sequence for the product.

## Section: Binary Representation Uniqueness

This section proves that every natural number has a unique binary representation,
which is Theorem `thm.fps.laure.binary-rep-uniq` in the source material.

A binary representation of `n ∈ ℕ` is an essentially finite sequence `(bᵢ)_{i ∈ ℕ}` with
`bᵢ ∈ {0, 1}` such that `n = ∑_{i ∈ ℕ} bᵢ · 2^i`.

In Mathlib, this is captured by the equivalence `Finset.equivBitIndices : ℕ ≃ Finset ℕ`,
where a finset `s ⊆ ℕ` represents the binary sequence with `bᵢ = 1` iff `i ∈ s`.
-/

section BinaryRepresentation

open Finset in
/-- **Binary Representation Definition**.

A binary representation of `n` is a finset `s ⊆ ℕ` such that `n = ∑_{i ∈ s} 2^i`.
This is equivalent to specifying which bits are 1 in the binary expansion.

The essentially finite sequence `(bᵢ)_{i ∈ ℕ}` from the textbook corresponds to
`bᵢ = 1` if `i ∈ s`, and `bᵢ = 0` otherwise. -/

Each natural number `n` has a unique binary representation. More precisely, there exists
a unique finset `s ⊆ ℕ` such that `n = ∑_{i ∈ s} 2^i`.

This is a fundamental result that motivates the study of Laurent series: when trying to
prove the analogous result for balanced ternary representations (where coefficients can
be -1, 0, or 1), we need to work with negative powers of the base, which leads naturally
to Laurent series. -/

## Section: Balanced Ternary Representation Uniqueness

This section proves Theorem `thm.fps.laure.balanced-tern-rep-uniq`: Every integer
has a unique balanced ternary representation.

A **balanced ternary representation** of an integer `n` is an essentially finite
sequence `(b_i)_{i∈ℕ}` with `b_i ∈ {-1, 0, 1}` such that `n = ∑_{i∈ℕ} b_i · 3^i`.

The proof uses Laurent polynomials and the key identity:
  `∏_{i=0}^{k} (1 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i}) = ∑_{|n| ≤ M_k} x^n`
where `M_k = 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^k = (3^{k+1} - 1) / 2`.

Comparing coefficients shows that each integer in `[-M_k, M_k]` has exactly one
k-bounded balanced ternary representation. Taking `k → ∞` gives the full result.

A balanced ternary representation of an integer `n` is a finitely supported

allows digits to be -1, 0, or 1. This enables direct representation of

The proof uses a cardinality argument:
- There are `3^{k+1}` k-bounded representations (`card_kBoundedBTReps`)
- The target set `Icc_symm (maxBT k)` has cardinality `3^{k+1}` (`card_Icc_symm_maxBT`)
- Each representation maps to a value in the target set (`kBoundedBTValue_mem_Icc`)
- By the pigeonhole principle, the map is a bijection

/-- **Unique Balanced Ternary Representation Theorem**.
(Theorem thm.fps.laure.balanced-tern-rep-uniq, label: thm.fps.laure.balanced-tern-rep-uniq)

Each integer `n` has a unique balanced ternary representation. More precisely, there exists
a unique finitely supported function `f : ℕ → ℤ` with values in {-1, 0, 1} such that
`n = ∑_{i ∈ support(f)} f(i) · 3^i`.

This theorem generalizes the binary representation uniqueness to allow negative digits,
which enables representing negative integers directly (without a separate sign).

The proof uses Laurent polynomials and the key identity:
  `∏_{i=0}^{k} (1 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i}) = ∑_{|n| ≤ M_k} x^n`
where `M_k = 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^k = (3^{k+1} - 1) / 2`.

Comparing coefficients shows that each integer in `[-M_k, M_k]` has exactly one
k-bounded balanced ternary representation. Taking `k → ∞` gives the full result.

Historical note: Balanced ternary representations were used in the Soviet Setun computer
(1960s/70s). The uniqueness theorem goes back to Fibonacci. -/

## Section: Equivalence with Alternative Balanced Ternary Representation

This section establishes the equivalence between the `BalancedTernaryRep` structure
defined in this file (using `ℕ →₀ ℤ` with `btDigits` constraint) and the 
`AlgebraicCombinatorics.BalancedTernaryRepresentation` structure defined in 
`LaurentSeries.lean` (using an inductive `BalancedTernaryDigit` type).

Both representations capture the same mathematical concept: balanced ternary 
representations of integers. The equivalence theorems below show that:
1. Any `BalancedTernaryRepresentation` can be converted to a `BalancedTernaryRep`
2. Any `BalancedTernaryRep` can be converted to a `BalancedTernaryRepresentation`  
3. These conversions are inverses of each other (up to the digit representation)

This provides a bridge between the two equivalent formulations.
