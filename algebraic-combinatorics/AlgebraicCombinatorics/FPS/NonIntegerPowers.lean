# Non-integer Powers of Formal Power Series

This file formalizes non-integer powers of formal power series (FPS) and the generalized
Newton binomial formula, following Section 7.12 (sec.gf.nips) of the source.

## Main Definitions

* `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.fpsPow`: The c-th power f^c for f ∈ K⟦X⟧₁ (FPS with constant term 1) and c ∈ K,
  defined as `Exp(c * Log f)` (Definition def.fps.power-c).

## Main Results

* `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.fpsPow_add`: The rule f^{a+b} = f^a * f^b (Theorem thm.fps.power-c.rules).
* `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.fpsPow_mul`: The rule (fg)^a = f^a * g^a (Theorem thm.fps.power-c.rules).
* `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.fpsPow_pow`: The rule (f^a)^b = f^{ab} (Theorem thm.fps.power-c.rules).
* `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.generalizedNewtonBinomial`: The generalized Newton binomial formula
  (1+x)^c = ∑_{k ∈ ℕ} C(c,k) x^k (Theorem thm.fps.gen-newton).
* `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.binomialIdentity`: The binomial identity
  ∑_{i=0}^k C(n+i-1,i) C(n,k-2i) = C(n+k-1,k) (Proposition prop.binom.nCk-2i-qedmo.CN).

## Implementation Notes

The definition of f^c uses the Exp and Log maps from Mathlib. Specifically:
- For f ∈ K⟦X⟧₁ (constant term 1), we define f^c := Exp(c * Log f)
- This requires K to be a commutative ℚ-algebra

The generalized Newton binomial formula is proved using the polynomial identity trick:
both sides are polynomials in c that agree on ℕ, hence they agree everywhere.

## The Exp and Log Maps

We use Mathlib's `PowerSeries.exp` for the exponential series.
For the logarithm, we define it via the standard series log(1+x) = ∑_{n≥1} (-1)^{n-1}/n * x^n.

## The Log Map for FPS with Constant Term 1

For f ∈ K⟦X⟧₁, we define Log(f) by substituting (f-1) into the log series.
Since f has constant term 1, f-1 has constant term 0, so the substitution is well-defined.

/-- The exponential functional equation: Exp(x + y) = Exp(x) * Exp(y)
    This is a fundamental property of the exponential series.
    For power series x, y with constant term 0:
    exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y)
    Label: (exp functional equation)

    **Proof strategy** (from the textbook):
    Both sides satisfy the same differential equation with the same initial condition.
    Let F(x,y) = exp(x+y) and G(x,y) = exp(x) * exp(y).
    - ∂F/∂x = exp(x+y) = F and ∂F/∂y = exp(x+y) = F
    - ∂G/∂x = exp(x) * exp(y) = G and ∂G/∂y = exp(x) * exp(y) = G
    - F(0,0) = exp(0) = 1 and G(0,0) = exp(0) * exp(0) = 1
    By uniqueness of solutions to the ODE, F = G.

    **Alternative proof** (coefficient comparison):
    Use the Cauchy product formula and the fact that
    [x^n](exp(x+y)) = ∑_{k=0}^n [x^k](exp x) * [x^{n-k}](exp y) * C(n,k)
    which equals [x^n](exp x * exp y) by the binomial theorem.

    **Mathlib note**: Mathlib's `exp_mul_exp_eq_exp_add` proves this for the special case
    where x = a • X and y = b • X (i.e., rescaling). The general case requires the
    derivative characterization or coefficient comparison. -/

    **Alternative proof**:
    Use the inverse property: if Exp and Log are inverses, then
    Log(fg) = Log(Exp(Log f) * Exp(Log g)) = Log(Exp(Log f + Log g)) = Log f + Log g.

    **Dependency**: This proof requires either the derivative characterization

## Definition of Non-integer Powers (Definition def.fps.power-c)

For f ∈ K⟦X⟧₁ and c ∈ K, we define f^c := Exp(c * Log(f)).

This definition:
- Does not conflict with integer powers (since Log and Exp are inverses on the appropriate domains)
- Makes the rules of exponents hold
- Yields (1+x)^c = ∑ C(c,k) x^k (generalized Newton binomial formula)

## Generalized Newton Binomial Formula (Theorem thm.fps.gen-newton)

For any c ∈ K (where K is a commutative ℚ-algebra):
(1+x)^c = ∑_{k ∈ ℕ} C(c,k) x^k

where C(c,k) = c(c-1)(c-2)⋯(c-k+1)/k! is the generalized binomial coefficient.

Note: We need K to be a BinomialRing to use Ring.choose. Since K is a ℚ-algebra,
it has a BinomialRing structure.

### Key lemmas for the proof

The proof strategy is:
1. Show that `fpsLog (1+X) = logSeries`
2. Show that `fpsPow (1+X) c = fpsExp (c • logSeries)`
3. Show that for natural `n`, `fpsExp (n • logSeries) = (1+X)^n` using the exp functional equation
4. Use `binomialSeries_nat`: `binomialSeries K n = (1+X)^n`
5. Apply the polynomial identity trick: both sides have polynomial coefficients in `c`
   that agree on all natural numbers, hence they agree everywhere

/-- The generalized Newton binomial formula: (1+x)^c = ∑_{k ∈ ℕ} C(c,k) x^k

    This extends the standard Newton binomial formula (Theorem thm.fps.newton-binom)
    from natural number exponents to arbitrary exponents in a ℚ-algebra.

    The proof uses the polynomial identity trick: both sides of the coefficient equality
    are polynomials in c that agree on ℕ (by the standard Newton formula), hence they
    agree everywhere.

    **Proof outline:**
    For each coefficient `k`, we need to show `coeff k ((1+X)^c) = Ring.choose c k`.

    1. Both sides are polynomial functions of `c` with rational coefficients:
       - `Ring.choose c k = descPochhammer(c, k) / k!` is a polynomial of degree `k`
       - `coeff k (fpsExp (c • logSeries))` is also a polynomial in `c` (by expanding
         the exponential series and collecting terms)

    2. For natural `c = n`, both sides equal `Nat.choose n k`:
       - `Ring.choose n k = Nat.choose n k` by `Ring.choose_natCast`
       - `coeff k ((1+X)^n) = Nat.choose n k` by the standard binomial theorem

    3. By the polynomial identity trick: two polynomials (over ℚ) that agree on all
       natural numbers must be equal. Hence the coefficients agree for all `c ∈ K`.

  -- For coeff k (fpsPow (1+X) c) = coeff k (exp.subst (c • logSeries)):

  -- which is a polynomial in c of degree ≤ k.
  --
  -- Both polynomials agree on infinitely many points (all of ℕ).
  -- By Polynomial.eq_zero_of_infinite_isRoot, the difference is 0.
  -- Hence the polynomials are equal, and so are the evaluations.
  --
  -- For coefficient k, both sides satisfy the Chu-Vandermonde identity:

  -- (fpsPow (1+X) by convolution, binomialSeries K by Ring.add_choose_eq).

  -- Both f(c) = coeff k (fpsPow (1+X) c) and g(c) = Ring.choose c k are
  -- polynomial functions of c (of degree ≤ k) that agree on all n ∈ ℕ.
  -- Since there are infinitely many natural numbers and the polynomials
  -- have finite degree, they must be equal (by the polynomial identity
  -- principle over ℚ, which extends to any ℚ-algebra K).
  --
  -- The polynomial for g(c) = Ring.choose c k is explicit:
  -- g(c) = (1/k!) * c(c-1)(c-2)...(c-k+1) = (1/k!) * descPochhammer(c, k)
  --
  -- The polynomial for f(c) = coeff k (fpsPow (1+X) c) comes from:

  -- which is a polynomial in c of degree ≤ k with ℚ-coefficients.
  --
  -- Since f(n) = g(n) for all n ∈ ℕ (by h_nat), and both are polynomials

## Another Application: A Binomial Identity (Proposition prop.binom.nCk-2i-qedmo.CN)

For n ∈ ℂ and k ∈ ℕ:
∑_{i=0}^k C(n+i-1, i) C(n, k-2i) = C(n+k-1, k)

The proof uses generating functions:
- Define f = ∑_{i ∈ ℕ} C(n+i-1, i) x^{2i} = (1-x²)^{-n}
- Define g = ∑_{j ∈ ℕ} C(n, j) x^j = (1+x)^n
- Then fg = (1-x)^{-n} = ∑_{i ∈ ℕ} C(n+i-1, i) x^i
- Comparing coefficients of x^k gives the identity

### Helper Lemmas for the Binomial Identity

We prove the identity using generating functions:
- Define f = ∑_{i ∈ ℕ} C(n+i-1, i) x^{2i}
- Define g = ∑_{j ∈ ℕ} C(n, j) x^j = (1+x)^n
- Show that fg = (1-x)^{-n} using the factorization (1-x²) = (1-x)(1+x)
- Compare coefficients of x^k

## The Proof Method: Polynomial Identity Trick

The proof of the generalized Newton formula uses the "polynomial identity trick":
If two polynomials (with rational coefficients) agree on all natural numbers,
they must be equal as polynomials, and hence agree on all values in any ℚ-algebra.

This is formalized in Mathlib as polynomial equality from infinitely many roots.
-/

/-- The polynomial identity trick: If a polynomial has infinitely many roots, it is zero.
    This is the key lemma used in the proof of the generalized Newton formula.

    Note: This requires `CharZero R` to ensure that the natural numbers are distinct when
    coerced to R. Without this assumption, the theorem is false: for example, in `ZMod 2`,
    the polynomial `x(x-1)` evaluates to 0 at all natural numbers but is nonzero.
