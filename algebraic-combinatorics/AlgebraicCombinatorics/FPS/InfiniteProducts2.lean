# Product Rules (Generalized Distributive Laws) for Infinite Products

This file formalizes the product rules for expanding products of sums, both finite and infinite,
following the treatment in the AlgebraicCombinatorics book.

## Main definitions

* `EssentiallyFinite`: A family `(k_i)_{i ∈ I}` is essentially finite if all but finitely many
  `i ∈ I` satisfy `k_i = 0`. This is used to describe which terms appear when expanding
  infinite products of sums.

## Main results

### Finite Product Rules
* `prod_sum_eq_sum_prod_finset`: (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-fin-fin) A finite product of
  finite sums equals a sum over the Cartesian product of the index sets.
* `prod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_finset`: (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-fin-inf) A finite product of
  infinite summable families equals a sum over the Cartesian product.

### Infinite Product Rules
* `tprod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_essentiallyFinite_nat`: (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-inf-infN)
  An infinite product of sums (indexed by positive integers) equals a sum over essentially
  finite sequences.
* `tprod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_essentiallyFinite`: (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf)
  General version with arbitrary index set `I`.

### Applications
* `euler_odd_parts_identity`: (Proposition prop.gf.prod.euler-odd) Euler's identity:
  `∏_{i>0} (1 - x^{2i-1})⁻¹ = ∏_{k>0} (1 + x^k)`
* `euler_distinct_odd_partitions`: (Theorem thm.gf.prod.euler-comb) The number of partitions
  of `n` into distinct parts equals the number of partitions into odd parts.

### Substitution
* `tprod_rescale_substitution`: (Proposition prop.fps.subs.rule-infprod) Infinite products
  commute with rescaling (a special case of substitution).

### Exp/Log
The source material includes Propositions prop.fps.Exp-Log-infsum and prop.fps.Exp-Log-infprod
relating infinite sums/products via Exp and Log maps. The canonical definitions for FPS with
constant term 0 or 1 (`PowerSeries₀` and `PowerSeries₁`) are in `FPS/ExpLog.lean`.

/-! ## Essentially Finite Families

A family `(k_i)_{i ∈ I}` is essentially finite if all but finitely many `i ∈ I` satisfy `k_i = 0`.
This notion is crucial for stating product rules for infinite products.
-/

/-- A family `f : I → M` is essentially finite if all but finitely many values are zero.
This is equivalent to `f` having finite support.

(Definition def.fps.prodrule.ess-fin)

**Canonical definition**: This is the canonical, most general definition of `EssentiallyFinite`.
It is **definitionally equal** to:
- `AlgebraicCombinatorics.FPS.EssentiallyFinite` in `FPSDefinition.lean`
- `PowerSeries.EssentiallyFinite` in `Details/InfiniteProducts2.lean`

All use `{i | f i ≠ 0}.Finite` which equals `(Function.support f).Finite` by definition.
This version has the richest API in the `EssentiallyFinite` namespace. -/
def EssentiallyFinite {I M : Type*} [Zero M] (f : I → M) : Prop :=

/-- A sequence `(k₁, k₂, k₃, ...)` of natural numbers is essentially finite if all but
finitely many terms are zero. -/

/-- **Summability of finite product families** (discrete case)

For discrete `K`, the family `f ↦ ∏ i, p i (f i)` is summable when each `p i` is summable.
This is the key technical lemma for `prod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_finset`.

**Proof strategy**: For each coefficient `d`, only finitely many `f` contribute:
- Define `T i` = union of supports of `coeff m ∘ (p i)` for `m ≤ d`
- Each `T i` is finite (by discrete summability)
- The set `{f | ∀ i, f i ∈ T i}` is finite (product of finite sets)
- If `f i ∉ T i` for some `i`, then `coeff d (∏ j, p j (f j)) = 0`

This proves that the support of `f ↦ coeff d (∏ i, p i (f i))` is finite. -/

/-- **Finite Product Rule for Infinite Sums** (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-fin-inf)

For a finite product of summable families:
`∏_{i=1}^n (∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k}) = ∑_{(k₁,...,k_n) ∈ S₁×...×S_n} ∏_{i=1}^n p_{i,k_i}`

(Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-fin-infJ is the version with general finite index set)

**Proof strategy**: By induction on n.
- Base case (n=0): Both sides equal 1.
- Inductive step: Split the product into first n factors and the last factor, use IH on
  the first n, then apply the multiplication rule for sums.

**Note**: This theorem requires `DiscreteTopology K`. This covers the main use cases
(integers, rationals, finite fields). For non-discrete `K` (like ℝ or ℂ), additional
assumptions (such as absolute summability) would be needed. -/

/-- **Finite Product Rule for Infinite Sums** (discrete case, fully proved)

For a finite product of summable families over `Fin n`:
`∏_{i=1}^n (∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k}) = ∑_{(k₁,...,k_n) ∈ S₁×...×S_n} ∏_{i=1}^n p_{i,k_i}`

This is the discrete topology version of `prod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_finset`, with a complete proof.
The key insight is that in discrete topology, summability implies finite support for each
coefficient, which allows us to prove summability of the product family directly.

**Proof strategy**: By induction on n.
- Base case (n=0): Both sides equal 1.
- Inductive step: Split the product into first n factors and the last factor, use IH on
  the first n, then apply the multiplication rule for sums.
- Summability of the product family is proved using `summable_finProd_discrete` and
  `summable_prod_of_summable_discrete`. -/

/-! ### Summable Fiber Lemma (Complete Space Version)

This section proves that fibers of summable families are summable when the coefficient
ring K is a complete uniform space. This is stronger than the discrete case but requires
completeness.

/-- **Claim 1 from tex proof**: For each i ∈ I, the family (p_{i,k})_{k ∈ S_i} is summable.

This follows from the assumption that (p_{i,k})_{(i,k) ∈ S̄} is summable, since
each subfamily is summable.

**Proof strategy**: The family (p i k)_{k ∈ S_i} is summable because:
1. The subfamily (p i k)_{k ∈ S_i, k ≠ 0} is summable (as a subfamily of the summable family)
2. Adding the term p i 0 preserves summability

The key steps are:
- Use `summable_iff_summable_coeff` to reduce to coefficient-wise summability
- For each coefficient, use `Summable.indicator_complete` to show the fiber is summable
- Split the sum at k = 0 and combine

**Note**: This proof requires `CompleteSpace K` because subfamilies of summable families
are only guaranteed to be summable in complete spaces. For the discrete topology case,
use `summable_fiber_discrete` instead (which doesn't require completeness). -/

/-- **Claim 7 from tex proof**: The family (∏_i p_{i,k_i})_{(k_i) ∈ S^I_fin} is summable.

This is the key summability result for the RHS. The proof shows that for each n,
only finitely many essentially finite families (k_i) contribute to the n-th coefficient.

**Proof strategy** (following the tex source):

1. Use `summable_iff_summable_coeff` to reduce to coefficient-wise summability.

2. For each coefficient n, define T'_n = { (i,k) : k ≠ 0, ∃ m ≤ n, coeff m (p i k) ≠ 0 }.
   This set is finite because hp_summable implies coefficient-wise summability.

3. Define ValidFun_n = { f essentially finite | graph(f) ⊆ T'_n }.
   This set is finite because it injects into the powerset of T'_n.

4. Show that if f ∉ ValidFun_n, then coeff n (∏' i, p i (f.val i)) = 0.
   This uses the irrelevance lemma: if (i, f i) ∉ T'_n for some i with f i ≠ 0,
   then p i (f i) = 1 + (terms of order > n), so the n-th coefficient is unaffected.

5. Apply `summable_of_finite_support` to conclude.

**Note**: The proof requires discrete topology on K to show T'_n is finite via
`Summable.finite_support_of_discreteTopology`. For general topological rings,
the finiteness of T'_n from coefficient-wise summability would need additional
structure beyond T2Space. -/

/-- **General Infinite Product Rule** (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-inf-inf)

For any index set `I`, let `(S_i)_{i ∈ I}` be sets that all contain `0`.
For `p_{i,k} ∈ K⟦X⟧` with `p_{i,0} = 1`, if the family `(p_{i,k})_{(i,k) ∈ S̄}` is summable, then:

`∏_{i ∈ I} (∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k}) = ∑_{essentially finite (k_i)_{i ∈ I}} ∏_{i ∈ I} p_{i,k_i}`

The key insight is that only essentially finite families contribute to the sum on the RHS,
ensuring that each product `∏_{i ∈ I} p_{i,k_i}` is well-defined (since all but finitely
many factors are `p_{i,0} = 1`).

**Proof status**: This theorem requires substantial infrastructure:
- `prod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_finset'_discrete`: finite product of infinite sums (fully proved)
- `coeff_mul_tprod_one_add_eq_coeff`: irrelevance of high-order terms (proved)

The proof strategy (from the tex source) involves:
1. For each coefficient n, define finite approximating sets
2. Show both sides reduce to finite sums/products on these sets
3. Apply the finite distributive law
4. Use the irrelevance lemma to show high-order terms don't contribute

  -- **Proof structure** (following Claims 8, 10, 11 from the tex source):
  --
  -- **Claim 8 (RHS reduction)**: For the RHS, we show that only essentially finite
  -- functions with support contained in I_n contribute to coeff n:
  --   ∑' f, coeff n (∏' i, p i (f i)) = ∑_{f ∈ S^{I_n}} coeff n (∏_{i ∈ I_n} p i (f i))
  --
  -- This uses:
  -- - Claim 5: If some (j, k_j) ∈ S̄ \ T'_n, then coeff n (∏_i p_{i,k_i}) = 0
  --   (because p_j k_j has order > n, so by coeff_prod_eq_zero_of_factor_coeff_zero)
  -- - Claim 6: If f ∈ S^I_fin \ S^I_{I_n}, then coeff n (∏_i p_{i,k_i}) = 0
  --   (follows from Claim 5)
  -- - For f ∈ S^I_{I_n}, we have ∏' i, p i (f i) = ∏_{i ∈ I_n} p i (f i)
  --   (since p i 0 = 1 for i ∉ I_n)
  --
  -- **Claim 10 (LHS reduction)**: For the LHS, we use the irrelevance lemma:
  --   coeff n (∏' i, ∑' k, p i k) = coeff n (∏_{i ∈ I_n} ∑' k, p i k)
  --
  -- This uses:
  -- - Claim 9: For i ∈ I \ I_n, [x^m](∑_{k≠0} p_{i,k}) = 0 for m ≤ n
  --   (since all (i,k) with i ∉ I_n are in S̄ \ T'_n)
  -- - coeff_mul_tprod_one_add_eq_coeff: the irrelevance lemma
  --
  -- **Claim 11 (finite product rule)**: The finite product rule gives:
  --   ∏_{i ∈ I_n} ∑' k, p i k = ∑_{f ∈ S^{I_n}} ∏_{i ∈ I_n} p i (f i)
  --
  -- This is prod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_finset'_discrete (which is now fully proved).
  --
  -- **Combining**: Claims 8, 10, 11 show both sides equal the same finite expression:
  --   coeff n (LHS) = coeff n (∏_{i ∈ I_n} ∑' k, p i k)  [by Claim 10]
  --                 = coeff n (∑_{f ∈ S^{I_n}} ∏_{i ∈ I_n} p i (f i))  [by Claim 11]
  --                 = coeff n (RHS)  [by Claim 8]
  --
  -- **Proof for discrete K**:
  -- For discrete K, both sides have finite support at each coefficient level.
  -- The key is that both sides equal the same finite sum over functions with graph in T'n.

  -- **RHS analysis**: The tsum ∑' f, coeff n (∏' i, p i (f i)) has finite support.
  -- Only functions f with graph(f) ⊆ T'n contribute (others have coeff n = 0).
  -- This is because if (i, f i) ∉ T'n for some i with f i ≠ 0, then
  -- coeff m (p i (f i)) = 0 for all m ≤ n, so by coeff_prod_eq_zero_of_factor_coeff_zero,
  -- coeff n (∏' i, p i (f i)) = 0.

  -- **LHS analysis**: For the LHS, we show coeff n (∏' i, ∑' k, p i k) equals the same sum.
  -- Write ∑' k, p i k = 1 + ∑' k≠0, p i k for each i.
  -- For i ∉ I_n, the sum ∑' k≠0, p i k has all coefficients up to n equal to 0.
  -- By the irrelevance lemma (coeff_mul_tprod_one_add_eq_coeff), the factors for i ∉ I_n
  -- don't affect coeff n of the product.
  -- So coeff n (∏' i, ∑' k, p i k) = coeff n (∏ i ∈ I_n.toFinset, ∑' k, p i k).

  -- The finite product over I_n can be expanded coefficient-wise to give a sum over
  -- functions I_n → S, which matches the RHS when restricted to functions with graph in T'n.

  -- So both sides are determined by the finite set I_n

  -- The equality follows from the finite product rule applied to the finite set I_n
  -- and the correspondence between functions I_n → S and essentially finite functions with support in I_n

  -- For discrete K, this can be verified by showing both sides have the same finite support

  -- - RHS contributes coeff n (∏' i, p i (f i)) = coeff n (∏ i ∈ supp(f), p i (f i))

/-- **Infinite Product Rule** (Proposition prop.fps.prodrule-inf-infN)

Let `S₁, S₂, S₃, ...` be sets that all contain `0`. For `p_{i,k} ∈ K⟦X⟧` with `p_{i,0} = 1`,
if the family `(p_{i,k})_{(i,k) ∈ S̄}` is summable, then:

`∏_{i=1}^∞ (∑_{k ∈ S_i} p_{i,k}) = ∑_{essentially finite (k₁,k₂,...)} ∏_{i=1}^∞ p_{i,k_i}`

The key insight is that only essentially finite sequences contribute to the sum on the RHS,
ensuring that each product `∏_{i=1}^∞ p_{i,k_i}` is well-defined (since all but finitely
many factors are `p_{i,0} = 1`).

This is a special case of `tprod_tsum_eq_tsum_prod_essentiallyFinite` with `I = ℕ+`. -/

/-- **Euler's Identity** (Proposition prop.gf.prod.euler-odd)

`∏_{i>0} (1 - x^{2i-1})⁻¹ = ∏_{k>0} (1 + x^k)`

This identity relates the generating function for partitions into odd parts
to the generating function for partitions into distinct parts.

The proof uses the fact that:
- The RHS is the generating function for partitions into distinct parts
- The LHS is the generating function for partitions into odd parts
- By Glaisher's theorem, these partition counts are equal

The algebraic proof (from the TeX source) shows:
1. `(1 + x^k)(1 - x^k) = 1 - x^{2k}`
2. `∏_{k>0}(1 + x^k) = ∏_{k>0}(1 - x^{2k}) / ∏_{k>0}(1 - x^k)`
3. The even factors cancel, leaving `1 / ∏_{k odd}(1 - x^k)` -/

infinite products: `rescale a (∏_{i ∈ I} f_i) = ∏_{i ∈ I} (rescale a (f_i))`.

/-! ## Exponentials, Logarithms and Infinite Products

The Exp and Log maps convert between infinite sums and products.
These results require K to be a ℚ-algebra for the formal exp and log to be defined.

**Note on formalization status:**

The source material (Propositions prop.fps.Exp-Log-infsum and prop.fps.Exp-Log-infprod) states:
- `Exp(∑_{i ∈ I} f_i) = ∏_{i ∈ I} Exp(f_i)` for summable families in `K⟦X⟧_0`
- `Log(∏_{i ∈ I} f_i) = ∑_{i ∈ I} Log(f_i)` for multipliable families in `K⟦X⟧_1`

These require:
1. A general composition/substitution operation for power series (to define `Exp(f)` for `f` with
   zero constant term)
2. A formal logarithm `Log : K⟦X⟧_1 → K⟦X⟧_0` (not yet in Mathlib)

The finite versions use `PowerSeries.exp_mul_exp_eq_exp_add`: `exp(aX) * exp(bX) = exp((a+b)X)`.
Once the infrastructure is available, the infinite versions should follow by taking limits.
-/

/-! ## Exp/Log Placeholder Section

The source material includes Propositions `prop.fps.Exp-Log-infsum` and `prop.fps.Exp-Log-infprod`
relating infinite sums/products via Exp and Log maps.

**Canonical definitions for FPS with constant term 0 or 1:**
- `PowerSeries.PowerSeries₀` (FPS with constant term 0) — see `FPS/ExpLog.lean`
- `PowerSeries.PowerSeries₁` (FPS with constant term 1) — see `FPS/ExpLog.lean`

These definitions have extensive API including:
- `PowerSeries₀.addSubgroup` — additive subgroup structure
- `PowerSeries₁.subgroup` — multiplicative subgroup structure (for fields)
- Membership lemmas (`mem_PowerSeries₀_iff`, `mem_PowerSeries₁_iff`)
- Closure properties (`add_mem`, `mul_mem`, `inv_mem`, etc.)
- Composition lemmas (`subst_mem`, `exp_subst_mem_PowerSeries₁`, etc.)
- The `Exp` and `Log` maps between these sets

Once the Exp/Log infrastructure from `ExpLog.lean` is integrated, the infinite versions
(`prop.fps.Exp-Log-infsum` and `prop.fps.Exp-Log-infprod`) can be formalized by taking limits.

For a summable sequence `(a_n)_{n ∈ ℕ}`:
`∏_{i ∈ ℕ} (1 + a_i) = ∑_{i₁ < i₂ < ... < i_k} a_{i₁} a_{i₂} ... a_{i_k}`

The RHS is a sum over all finite strictly increasing sequences of indices.

**Note**: This theorem requires `K` to have discrete topology. This covers the main use cases
(integers, rationals, finite fields). For non-discrete `K` (like ℝ or ℂ), additional
