# Polynomials

This file formalizes the relationship between polynomials and formal power series (FPS),
following the treatment in the Algebraic Combinatorics book.

## Main Content

The key insight is that polynomials can be viewed as FPSs with only finitely many nonzero
coefficients. In Mathlib:
- `PowerSeries R` (notation: `R⟦X⟧`) is the type of formal power series
- `Polynomial R` (notation: `R[X]`) is the type of univariate polynomials
- `Polynomial.toPowerSeries` embeds polynomials into power series

## Main Definitions

* `FPS.IsPolynomial` - A predicate characterizing when a power series is a polynomial
  (i.e., has only finitely many nonzero coefficients)
* `FPS.polynomialSubalgebra` - The K-subalgebra of polynomial power series (Theorem 7.5.2)
* `FPS.polynomialSubring` - The subring of polynomial power series (Theorem 7.5.2)
* `FPS.polynomialSubmodule` - The K-submodule of polynomial power series (Theorem 7.5.2)
* `FPS.polyEval` - Polynomial evaluation at an element of a K-algebra (Definition 7.5.6)
* Notation `f⦃a⦄` for polynomial evaluation (corresponds to book notation `f[a]`)

## Main Results

* `FPS.isPolynomial_iff_finite_support` - A power series is a polynomial iff it has finite support
* `FPS.isPolynomial_add` - The sum of polynomials is a polynomial
* `FPS.isPolynomial_mul` - The product of polynomials is a polynomial
* `FPS.isPolynomial_neg` - The negation of a polynomial is a polynomial
* `FPS.isPolynomial_sub` - The difference of polynomials is a polynomial

## Evaluation/Substitution (def.pol.subs)

The evaluation of a polynomial `f` at an element `a` of a `K`-algebra `A` is denoted
`polyEval f a` or `f⦃a⦄`. This corresponds to Definition 7.5.6 (def.pol.subs) in the source:
  f[a] := Σ_{n ∈ ℕ} f_n · a^n

Key properties (Theorem 7.5.7, thm.pol.eval.a+b):
- `(f + g)⦃a⦄ = f⦃a⦄ + g⦃a⦄` : `eval_add'`
- `(f * g)⦃a⦄ = f⦃a⦄ * g⦃a⦄` : `eval_mul'`
- `(c • f)⦃a⦄ = c • f⦃a⦄` : `eval_smul'`
- `C(c)⦃a⦄ = algebraMap K A c` : `eval_C'`
- `X⦃a⦄ = a` : `eval_X'`
- `X^i⦃a⦄ = a^i` : `eval_X_pow'`
- `f⦃g⦃a⦄⦄ = (f.comp g)⦃a⦄` : `eval_comp'`

Special cases:
- `f⦃x⦄ = f` : `eval_X_eq_self`
- `f⦃0⦄ = f₀` : `eval_zero_eq_coeff_zero`
- `f⦃1⦄ = sum of coefficients` : `eval_one_eq_sum_coeffs`

/-! ## Rings (Noncommutative Rings)

Definition 7.5.3 (def.alg.ring): A ring (also known as a noncommutative ring) is defined
in the same way as a commutative ring, except that the commutativity of multiplication
axiom is removed.

In Mathlib, this is captured by the `Ring` typeclass. Note that "noncommutative ring"
does not imply that the ring is not commutative; it merely means that commutativity
is not required. Thus, any commutative ring is a noncommutative ring.

Examples of noncommutative rings:
- Matrix rings `Matrix n n R` for any ring R and n > 1
- The quaternions `ℍ[R]` (Mathlib: `Quaternion`)
- Endomorphism rings `Module.End R M` for any R-module M

/-! ## K-Algebras

### Definition 7.5.5 (def.alg.Kalg): K-Algebras

The source defines a K-algebra as a set A equipped with four maps:
- `⊕ : A × A → A` (addition)
- `⊖ : A × A → A` (subtraction)
- `⊙ : A × A → A` (multiplication)
- `⇀ : K × A → A` (scalar multiplication)

and two elements `0⃗ ∈ A` (zero) and `1⃗ ∈ A` (one), satisfying three properties:

1. **A is a (noncommutative) ring**: The set A with ⊕, ⊖, ⊙, 0⃗, 1⃗ satisfies the ring axioms
   (same as commutative ring but without commutativity of multiplication).

2. **A is a K-module**: The set A with ⊕, ⊖, ⇀, 0⃗ satisfies the module axioms.

3. **Compatibility property** (equation 7.5.2):
   `λ ⇀ (a ⊙ b) = (λ ⇀ a) ⊙ b = a ⊙ (λ ⇀ b)` for all `λ ∈ K` and `a, b ∈ A`.

In Mathlib, this is captured by the `Algebra` typeclass, which requires:
- `[Semiring A]` (or `[Ring A]` for rings with subtraction)
- `[Algebra K A]` which provides scalar multiplication and the compatibility property

The key property `λ(ab) = (λa)b = a(λb)` is expressed via:
- `Algebra.smul_mul_assoc`: `r • x * y = r • (x * y)`
- `Algebra.mul_smul_comm`: `x * r • y = r • (x * y)`

either of its two factors by λ.

/-! ## Evaluation of Polynomials

Definition 7.5.6 (def.pol.subs): For a polynomial f ∈ K[x] and an element a of a K-algebra A,
we define f[a] := Σ_{n ∈ ℕ} f_n * a^n.

In Mathlib, this is `Polynomial.aeval a f` for evaluation in a K-algebra A.

### Implementation Notes

The book uses notation `f[a]` for polynomial evaluation. In Mathlib:
- `Polynomial.aeval a f` evaluates polynomial `f` at element `a` of a K-algebra
- `Polynomial.eval₂ φ a f` is more general, using a ring homomorphism `φ`
- `Polynomial.eval a f` evaluates in the base ring K itself

We provide `polyEval` as a wrapper matching the book's presentation.

/-- Evaluation of a polynomial at an element of a K-algebra.
This is Definition 7.5.6 (def.pol.subs).

Given a polynomial f ∈ K[X] and an element a of a K-algebra A,
we define f[a] := Σ_{n ∈ ℕ} f_n · a^n.

The sum is essentially finite since f is a polynomial (only finitely many
coefficients are nonzero).

In Mathlib, this is implemented as `Polynomial.aeval a f`. -/
