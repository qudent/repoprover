# x^n-Equivalence of Formal Power Series

This file formalizes the notion of x^n-equivalence of formal power series from
Section `sec.gf.xneq` of the source text.

## Main Definitions

* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv n f g`: Two FPS are x^n-equivalent if their first n+1 coefficients agree.
  This is written as `f ≡ g [mod X^(n+1)]` in the source, and is equivalent to
  `X^(n+1) ∣ (f - g)`.

## Main Results

* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.equivalence`: x^n-equivalence is an equivalence relation.
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.add`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by addition.
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.sub`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by subtraction.
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.mul`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by multiplication.
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.smul`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by scalar multiplication.
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.invOfUnit`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by inversion (for invertible FPS).
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.sum`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by finite sums.
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.prod`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by finite products.
* `PowerSeries.xnEquiv_iff_dvd`: f ≡ g [mod X^(n+1)] iff X^(n+1) ∣ (f - g).
* `PowerSeries.XnEquiv.comp`: x^n-equivalence is preserved by composition (with constant term 0).

## Implementation Notes

We define x^n-equivalence in terms of coefficient equality rather than divisibility,
as this is more directly usable in proofs. The equivalence to divisibility is
established in `xnEquiv_iff_dvd`.

The definition uses `n` for the degree, so `XnEquiv n f g` means the first `n+1`
coefficients agree (i.e., coefficients 0, 1, ..., n).

/-! ### Definition of x^n-equivalence -/

/-- Two formal power series are x^n-equivalent if their first n+1 coefficients agree.
This corresponds to Definition `def.fps.xneq` in the source text.

We say `XnEquiv n f g` to mean that for all m ∈ {0, 1, ..., n},
we have `[x^m] f = [x^m] g`. -/

  ∀ m ≤ n, coeff m f = coeff m g

/-- Notation for x^n-equivalence: `f ≡[x^n] g` means `XnEquiv n f g`.
This notation is used throughout the limits and infinite products theory. -/

/-! ### Characterization via divisibility (Proposition prop.fps.xneq-multiple)

This section proves `prop.fps.xneq-multiple`: Two FPS f and g satisfy
f ≡ g [mod X^(n+1)] if and only if the FPS f - g is a multiple of X^(n+1).
-/

/-- x^n-equivalence is equivalent to divisibility by X^(n+1)
(Proposition `prop.fps.xneq-multiple`).

Two FPS f and g satisfy f ≡ g [mod X^(n+1)] if and only if X^(n+1) divides f - g.

This is the main characterization theorem that connects the coefficient-wise
definition of x^n-equivalence to the divisibility formulation. -/

/-- Alternative statement of `prop.fps.xneq-multiple`:
f ≡ g [mod X^(n+1)] iff f - g is a multiple of X^(n+1).

This is definitionally equal to `xnEquiv_iff_dvd` since divisibility is defined
as the existence of such a quotient. The explicit existential form is sometimes
more convenient to work with. -/

/-- x^n-equivalence is equivalent to having equal truncations. -/

    simp only [pow_succ]
    exact ih.mul hab

/-! ### Composition (Proposition prop.fps.xneq.comp) -/

/-- Coefficients of f^k are zero for indices < k when constantCoeff f = 0.
This is a key lemma for proving that composition preserves x^n-equivalence. -/

/-- x^n-equivalence is preserved by composition when the inner series have constant term 0
(Proposition `prop.fps.xneq.comp`).

If a ≡ b [mod X^(n+1)] and c ≡ d [mod X^(n+1)] with [x^0]c = 0 and [x^0]d = 0,
then a ∘ c ≡ b ∘ d [mod X^(n+1)].

The proof follows the sketch in the source text:
1. Write a = ∑ aᵢ xⁱ and b = ∑ bᵢ xⁱ
2. For i ≤ n: aᵢ = bᵢ (by hab) and c^i ≡ d^i [mod X^(n+1)] (by XnEquiv.pow)
3. For i > n: [x^m](c^i) = [x^m](d^i) = 0 for all m ≤ n (since constantCoeff = 0)
4. Therefore a ∘ c ≡ b ∘ d [mod X^(n+1)] -/
