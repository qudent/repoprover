# Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem and Jacobi's Triple Product Identity

This file formalizes Euler's pentagonal number theorem and Jacobi's triple product identity,
following the treatment in the AlgebraicCombinatorics textbook.

## Main definitions

* `pentagonalNumber` : The k-th pentagonal number w_k = (3k - 1) * k / 2
* `Level` : A "level" is a half-integer p + 1/2 for some integer p (used in the proof)
* `State` : A "state" is a set of levels containing all but finitely many negative levels
  and only finitely many positive levels
* `State.energy` : The energy of a state
* `State.parnum` : The particle number of a state

## Main results

* `pentagonalNumber_nonneg` : Pentagonal numbers are nonnegative
* `euler_pentagonal_number_theorem` : ∏_{k≥1} (1 - x^k) = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k}
* `jacobi_triple_product` : Jacobi's triple product identity
* `partition_recursive` : Recursive formula for partition numbers using pentagonal numbers
* `euler_sum_divisors_recursive` : Euler's recursion for the sum of divisors function

(after `euler_pentagonal_number_theorem_rat`) due to dependency ordering.

/-- The inverse Euler product ∏_{k≥1} 1/(1-x^k).

This is defined using Mathlib's partition generating function framework.
By `Nat.Partition.genFun_eq_tprod`, this equals:
  ∏' i, (1 + ∑' j, X ^ ((i + 1) * (j + 1)))
which is the product ∏_{k≥1} (1 + X^k + X^{2k} + ...) = ∏_{k≥1} 1/(1-X^k). -/

/-- **Theorem \ref{thm.pars.main-gf}**: Main generating function for partitions.

  ∑_{n∈ℕ} p(n) x^n = ∏_{k≥1} 1/(1-x^k)

This is the fundamental identity connecting the partition function to
the infinite product. It is used in the proof of Corollary \ref{cor.pars.pn-rec}.

Note: This may also be available in Mathlib as `Nat.Partition.genFun` related theorems.

/-- The state generating function in JacobiRing:
  ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}

In Borcherds' proof, this is the key object that both the LHS and RHS of Jacobi's
triple product identity equal (after multiplying by the partition generating function).

Since states are in bijection with pairs (ℓ, μ) where ℓ ∈ ℤ and μ is a partition
(via `partitionToState_bijective`), and the bijection satisfies:
- energy(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ² + 2|μ| (by `excitedState_energy`)
- parnum(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ (by `excitedState_parnum`)

we can write the state generating function as:
  ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} ∑_{n≥0} ∑_{μ partition of n} q^{ℓ² + 2n} z^ℓ

This equals:
  ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ · ∑_{n≥0} (number of partitions of n) · q^{2n}

which is jacobiRHS' · partitionGenFun[q²].

substitution q ↦ q².

This is a key ingredient in proving Jacobi's triple product identity:

/-! ### (P, N) to State Bijection Infrastructure

The bijection between pairs (P, N) of finite subsets of ℕ and states is key to
proving `jacobiZZProduct_eq_stateGenFun`. Here we define the level set map and prove its properties.

Given (P, N):
- P represents the set of nonnegative integers in the state (positive half-integer levels)
- N represents the set of n such that -n-1 is NOT in the state (missing negative levels)

Note: The actual State definition is later in the file. The `finsetPairToState` function
is defined after State.

/-- Binary expansion formula for infinite products.
For a sequence a : ℕ → R of elements with increasing order, we have:
  ∏' n, (1 + a n) = ∑' P : Finset ℕ, ∏ n ∈ P, a n

This is the key formula for expanding the ZZ product.

The proof uses Mathlib's `tprod_one_add` theorem. The main work is establishing
summability of the RHS, which follows from order bounds:
- For each P, (∏ n ∈ P, a n).order ≥ ∑ n ∈ P, (2n+1) by `order_finset_prod_ge_sum_odd`
- For each degree d, only finitely many P have ∑ n ∈ P, (2n+1) ≤ d by `finite_finsets_sum_le`
- Therefore, only finitely many P contribute at each degree, ensuring summability

**Key helper lemmas**:
- `order_finset_prod_ge_sum_odd`: order bound for products over finite sets
- `finite_finsets_sum_le`: only finitely many P contribute at each degree

  provided that the RHS is summable. The key is showing summability of the sum over
  all finite subsets.

  For summability, we use the order bounds:
  - For each P, (∏ n ∈ P, a n).order ≥ ∑ n ∈ P, (2n+1) by `order_finset_prod_ge_sum_odd`
  - For each degree d, only finitely many P have ∑ n ∈ P, (2n+1) ≤ d by `finite_finsets_sum_le`

This combines the binary expansions of the Z and ZInv products.

/-- The right-hand side of Jacobi's triple product identity evaluated at q = u·x^a, z = v·x^b:
  ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} u^{ℓ²} v^ℓ x^{aℓ² + bℓ}

When a > 0 and a ≥ |b|, the exponent aℓ² + bℓ ≥ 0 for all ℓ ∈ ℤ, since:
  aℓ² + bℓ ≥ |b|·ℓ² - |b|·|ℓ| = |b|·|ℓ|·(|ℓ| - 1) ≥ 0

This is a well-defined element of ℚ⟦X⟧.
The infinite sum is summable because the exponent aℓ² + bℓ grows quadratically in |ℓ|.

this computes the coefficient at degree d:
- If e | d: the coefficient is u^(2*(k+1)*(d/e))
- Otherwise: the coefficient is 0

The key insight is that choosing exponent j in the geometric series contributes
degree e*j to X and exponent 2*(k+1)*j to u. So to get degree d, we need j = d/e
(if divisible), giving u exponent 2*(k+1)*(d/e).

/-- Key identity: `partitionGenFunEval * eulerProductParam = 1`.

This shows that `partitionGenFunEval` is the inverse of the Euler product.
The proof uses the geometric series identity: for each k,
  (∑' j, x_k^j) * (1 - x_k) = 1
where x_k = u^{2(k+1)} * X^{2a(k+1)}.

Combined with the product decomposition of partitions, this gives the result. -/

lemma partitionGenFunEval_mul_eulerProductParam (a : ℤ) (u : ℚ) (ha : a > 0) :
    partitionGenFunEval a u * eulerProductParam a u = 1 := by
  /-
  ## Proof Strategy

  The proof uses the following key facts:
  1. partitionGenFunEval = ∏' k, (∑' j, x_k^j) where x_k = u^{2(k+1)} * X^{2a(k+1)}
     This follows from the multiplicative structure of partitions: each partition
     is uniquely determined by the count of each part size.

  2. eulerProductParam = ∏' k, (1 - x_k)

  3. For each k: (∑' j, x_k^j) * (1 - x_k) = 1 (geometric series identity)

  4. Therefore: partitionGenFunEval * eulerProductParam
     = (∏' k, (∑' j, x_k^j)) * (∏' k, (1 - x_k))
     = ∏' k, ((∑' j, x_k^j) * (1 - x_k))
     = ∏' k, 1
     = 1

  The main technical challenge is showing step 1 and justifying the product interchange.
  
  ## Coefficient-level argument
  
  The coefficient of X^d in partitionGenFunEval is:
  - If d = 2an for some n ≥ 0: p(n) * u^(2n) (where p(n) is the partition count)
  - Otherwise: 0
  
  The coefficient of X^d in ∏' k, (∑' j, x_k^j) is:
  - Sum over all (j_k)_{k≥0} with ∑_k 2a(k+1)*j_k = d of ∏_k u^(2(k+1)*j_k)
  - This equals u^(2n) * (number of partitions of n) where n = d/(2a)
  
  The bijection is: (j_k) ↔ partition with j_k copies of part (k+1)

    ## Proof Sketch

    Both sides are power series. We prove equality by showing their coefficients match.

    **Left side (partitionGenFunEval):**
    - partitionGenFunEval a u = ∑' p : Σ n, Nat.Partition n, u^(2n) • X^(2an)
    - Coefficient at degree d:
      - If d = 2an for some n ∈ ℕ: coefficient = p(n) * u^(2n)
      - Otherwise: coefficient = 0

    **Right side (product of geometric series):**
    - ∏' k, (∑' j, (x k)^j) where x k = u^(2(k+1)) • X^(2a(k+1))
    - The product expands as a sum over finitely-supported sequences (j₀, j₁, ...):
      ∑_{(j_k)} ∏_k (x k)^{j_k}
    - Each term contributes: u^(2∑_k (k+1)j_k) • X^(2a∑_k (k+1)j_k)
    - The bijection: sequences with ∑_k (k+1)j_k = n ↔ partitions of n
      (where j_k = number of parts equal to k+1)
    - Coefficient at degree d = 2an: p(n) * u^(2n)
    - Coefficient at other degrees: 0

    **Conclusion:** Both sides have the same coefficients.

    The formal proof follows the same pattern as `Nat.Partition.hasProd_genFun` in Mathlib,
    using the bijection `Nat.Partition.toFinsuppAntidiag` between partitions and
    finitely-supported sequences. The key adaptation is tracking the scaled exponents.

    -- coeff d (∏' k, ∑' j, (x k)^j)
    -- By Mathlib's hasProd_genFun pattern:
    -- = ∑_{f : ℕ →₀ ℕ, ∑_k f(k) * (2a(k+1)).toNat = d} ∏_k u^(2(k+1)*f(k))
    --
    -- For f corresponding to a partition μ of n (via the bijection f_k = # parts of size k+1):
    -- - ∑_k f(k) * (2a(k+1)).toNat = (2an).toNat
    -- - ∏_k u^(2(k+1)*f(k)) = u^(2∑_k(k+1)f(k)) = u^(2n)
    --
    -- The bijection between partitions and finitely-supported sequences shows:
    -- coeff d (RHS) = if ∃ n, d = (2an).toNat then p(n) * u^(2n) else 0
    --
    -- This matches the LHS coefficient (proved in coeff_partitionGenFunEval).
    --
    -- The LHS coefficient is computed by coeff_partitionGenFunEval:
    -- coeff d (partitionGenFunEval a u) = ∑' p, if d = (2ap.1).toNat then u^(2p.1) else 0
    --
    -- The RHS coefficient follows the Mathlib hasProd_genFun pattern with scaled exponents.
    -- The key insight: both sides count partitions weighted by u^(2n) at degree (2an).toNat.
    --
    -- **Available helper lemmas:**
    -- - coeff_partitionGenFunEval: computes LHS coefficient
    -- - coeff_geom_series_smul_X_pow: computes coefficient of ∑' j, (c • X^e)^j
    -- - coeff_geom_series_large_k: for k with 2a(k+1) > d, factor contributes trivially
    --
    -- The proof uses the coefficient equality approach:
    -- Both sides have coefficient p(n) * u^(2n) at degree (2an).toNat, and 0 elsewhere.
    --
    -- We use the key insight that both sides equal expand e (genFun f)
    -- where e = (2*a).toNat and f(i,j) = u^(2*i*j).

/-- The product `jacobiRHSEval * partitionGenFunEval` equals the sum over all (ℓ, μ) pairs.

This is the key step in the RHS computation:
  jacobiRHSEval · partitionGenFunEval
  = (∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} u^{ℓ²} v^ℓ x^{aℓ² + bℓ}) · (∑_{μ partition} u^{2|μ|} x^{2a|μ|})
  = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} ∑_{μ partition} u^{ℓ² + 2|μ|} v^ℓ x^{a(ℓ² + 2|μ|) + bℓ}

By the bijection `partitionToState_bijective` and the formulas
`excitedState_energy` and `excitedState_parnum`, this equals:
  ∑_{S state} u^{energy(S)} v^{parnum(S)} x^{a·energy(S) + b·parnum(S)}

The proof uses the Cauchy product of infinite sums in the Pi topology on power series.

  ## Proof Strategy

  The proof uses `Summable.tsum_mul_tsum` to show that the product of two infinite sums
  equals the sum over all pairs:
    (∑' ℓ, f ℓ) * (∑' p, g p) = ∑' (ℓ,p), f ℓ * g p

  Key steps:
  1. Each term f ℓ * g p equals h (ℓ, p) by `product_term_eq'`
  2. Show summability of f, g, and h in the Pi topology
  3. Apply the Cauchy product formula `Summable.tsum_mul_tsum`

  The summability follows from finiteness: the exponent a*ℓ² + b*ℓ grows quadratically in |ℓ|,
  so only finitely many ℓ contribute to each coefficient.

/-! ## Proof Infrastructure: States and Levels -/

/-- A "level" is a half-integer, represented as p + 1/2 for some integer p.
We represent it simply by the integer p. -/
abbrev Level := ℤ

/-- A "state" is a set of levels that contains all but finitely many negative levels
and only finitely many positive levels.

This is used in Borcherds' proof of Jacobi's triple product identity.

**Important convention**: A "level" in the tex source is a half-integer `p + 1/2` for some integer p.
We represent it by the integer p. Thus:
- "positive level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 > 0`, i.e., `p ≥ 0` in our representation
- "negative level" in the tex source means `p + 1/2 < 0`, i.e., `p < 0` in our representation

The structure tracks:
- `finite_nonneg`: the set of nonnegative integers p (representing positive half-integer levels) in S
- `finite_negative_missing`: the set of negative integers p (representing negative half-integer levels) NOT in S -/
structure State where
  /-- The set of levels in this state -/
  levels : Set Level
  /-- Only finitely many nonnegative levels (p ≥ 0, representing positive half-integers p+1/2 > 0) are in the state -/
  finite_nonneg : Set.Finite {p : Level | p ≥ 0 ∧ p ∈ levels}
  /-- Only finitely many negative levels (p < 0, representing negative half-integers p+1/2 < 0) are NOT in the state -/
  finite_negative_missing : Set.Finite {p : Level | p < 0 ∧ p ∉ levels}

namespace State

/-- The energy of a state S is:
  energy(S) = ∑_{p≥0, p∈S} (2p+1) - ∑_{p<0, p∉S} (2p+1)

In the tex source, levels are half-integers `q = p + 1/2`, and the formula is:
  energy(S) = ∑_{q>0, q∈S} 2q - ∑_{q<0, q∉S} 2q

Substituting q = p + 1/2:
- q > 0 ⟺ p ≥ 0
- 2q = 2(p + 1/2) = 2p + 1

For p ≥ 0: 2p + 1 = 2*p.natAbs + 1 (since p.natAbs = p for p ≥ 0)
For p < 0: -(2p + 1) = -2p - 1 = 2*|p| - 1 = 2*p.natAbs - 1 (since p.natAbs = -p for p < 0)

Thus energy is always a natural number. -/
noncomputable def energy (S : State) : ℕ :=
  (S.finite_nonneg.toFinset.sum fun p => 2 * p.natAbs + 1) +
  (S.finite_negative_missing.toFinset.sum fun p => 2 * p.natAbs - 1)

/-- The particle number of a state S is:
  parnum(S) = #{p ≥ 0 : p ∈ S} - #{p < 0 : p ∉ S}

In the tex source, this counts the number of positive half-integer levels in S
minus the number of negative half-integer levels not in S. -/
noncomputable def parnum (S : State) : ℤ :=
  S.finite_nonneg.toFinset.card - S.finite_negative_missing.toFinset.card

/-- The ℓ-ground state G_ℓ = {all levels < ℓ}.

In the half-integer convention, G_ℓ contains all half-integer levels q < ℓ.
In our integer representation (where level q = p + 1/2), this is {p : p < ℓ}.

For ℓ ≥ 0:
- Nonnegative integers in G_ℓ: {0, 1, ..., ℓ-1}
- No negative integers are missing from G_ℓ

/-- The energy of the ground state G_ℓ is ℓ².

For ℓ ≥ 0:
- G_ℓ = {p : p < ℓ}
- Nonnegative integers in G_ℓ: {0, 1, ..., ℓ-1}
- Energy from nonneg: (2*0+1) + (2*1+1) + ... + (2*(ℓ-1)+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2ℓ-1) = ℓ²
- No negative integers are missing, so energy from neg_missing = 0
- Total energy = ℓ²

For ℓ < 0:
- G_ℓ = {p : p < ℓ}
- No nonnegative integers in G_ℓ, so energy from nonneg = 0
- Negative integers missing from G_ℓ: {ℓ, ℓ+1, ..., -1}
- Energy from neg_missing: (2*|ℓ|-1) + (2*|ℓ+1|-1) + ... + (2*|-1|-1)

                         = (2|ℓ|-1) + (2|ℓ|-3) + ... + 1 = |ℓ|² = ℓ²

The proof is technical and involves showing that:
- The sum 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n² (sum of first n odd numbers)
- The correct correspondence between the finite sets and the sums

/-- A jump by q steps raises the energy by 2q.

The proof tracks how the finite sums change when we jump from p to p+q:
- If p ≥ 0: p is removed from the nonneg set, contributing -(2*|p| + 1)
- If p+q ≥ 0: p+q is added to the nonneg set, contributing +(2*|p+q| + 1)

/-- The excited state is reachable from the ground state by a sequence of jumps.
This follows from the construction: we apply k jumps, one for each part of μ.

The proof proceeds by induction on the number of parts k = (mu.parts.sort (· ≥ ·)).length:
- Base case (k = 0): The excited state has levels {p | p < ell} = groundState.levels,
  so ReachableByJumps.refl applies.
- Inductive case (k > 0): We construct k jumps where the i-th jump (0-indexed) is
  from level (ell - 1 - i) by parts[i] steps. Each jump is valid because:
  1. (ell - 1 - i) is in the intermediate state (it's < ell - i)
  2. (ell - 1 - i + parts[i]) is NOT in the intermediate state (requires parts[i] > 0
     and no collision with previous jump targets)
  3. parts[i] > 0 (all parts of a partition are positive)

/-- excitedState is injective: different partitions give different states.
This follows from the fact that the levels in E_{ℓ,μ} uniquely encode μ.
The excited state records exactly which electrons jumped and by how much,
so the partition can be recovered from the state.

The proof uses the fact that with sorted parts, the function i ↦ parts[i] - i
is strictly decreasing, hence injective. This means the set of excited levels
{ell - 1 - i + parts[i] | i < k} uniquely determines the sequence of parts. -/

/-- Every state with particle number ℓ can be written as an excited state.
This is the "unjumping" operation: given S with parnum = ℓ, we find the unique
partition μ such that E_{ℓ,μ} = S by comparing S to the ground state G_ℓ
and extracting the jump sizes.

The construction proceeds as follows:
1. Let t = baseLevel S (the smallest level not in S)
2. Let k = ell - t (the number of parts, shown to be nonnegative)
3. The excited levels E = excitedLevelsFinset S has exactly k elements
4. Sort E decreasingly as [e_0, ..., e_{k-1}]
5. Define parts[i] = e_i - (ell - 1 - i) (shown to be positive)
6. The partition μ has parts given by this list
7. Verify that excitedState ell μ = S

The key insight is that the parnum calculation shows |E| = ell - t:
- For t ≥ 0: parnum = t + |E|, so |E| = ell - t
- For t < 0: parnum = |E| + t, so |E| = ell - t -/

/-! ### Bijection between (P, N) pairs and States

We establish a bijection between pairs (P, N) of finite subsets of ℕ and States.
- P represents the nonnegative levels in the state (n ∈ P means n ∈ S.levels)
- N represents the negative levels that are MISSING from the state
  (n ∈ N means -(n+1) ∉ S.levels, i.e., the negative level at position n is missing)

This bijection is key to proving `coeff_double_sum_eq_coeff_stateGenFun`.

**Key insight**: For a state S:
- The nonnegative levels in S form a finite set P ⊆ ℕ
- The negative levels missing from S can be indexed by a finite set N ⊆ ℕ
  where n ∈ N means the level -(n+1) is missing

Under this bijection:
- energy(S) = ∑_{n∈P}(2n+1) + ∑_{n∈N}(2n+1)
- parnum(S) = |P| - |N|

These formulas match the exponent and z-power in the double sum expansion of jacobiZZProduct.

/-- The energy of a state constructed from (P, N) equals the exponent in the double sum.

This is the key formula connecting the (P, N) parametrization to the state generating function:
  energy(fromFinsetPair P N) = ∑_{n∈P}(2n+1) + ∑_{n∈N}(2n+1)

The proof uses:
1. For nonnegative level n ∈ P: contribution is 2n + 1 = 2·n.natAbs + 1
2. For missing negative level -(n+1): contribution is 2·(n+1) - 1 = 2n + 1

Note: The energy formula for State uses (2·p.natAbs + 1) for nonneg and (2·p.natAbs - 1) for neg_missing.
For p = n ≥ 0: p.natAbs = n, so contribution is 2n + 1.
For p = -(n+1) < 0: p.natAbs = n + 1, so contribution is 2(n+1) - 1 = 2n + 1.
Both give 2n + 1, matching the double sum formula.

/-- The exponent for (P, N) equals the exponent for the corresponding (ℓ, μ).

This lemma shows that the bijection (P, N) ↔ (ℓ, μ) preserves the exponent:
  exponent(P, N) = (a * energy + b * parnum).toNat
                 = (a * (ℓ² + 2|μ|) + b * ℓ).toNat

where ℓ = |P| - |N| (parnum) and energy = ℓ² + 2|μ| (by fromFinsetPair_energy_parnum_relation).

This is the key lemma for `jacobiLHS_mul_partitionGenFun`: it shows that pairs (P, N) and (ℓ, μ)
with the same exponent are in bijection via the State infrastructure. -/

/-- Parameterized bijection lemma for coefficient equality in Jacobi triple product.

This lemma establishes that the coefficient sums over (P, N) pairs and (ℓ, μ) pairs
are equal when using the parameterized exponent formula.

The key insight is that the bijection (P, N) ↔ (ℓ, μ) via the State infrastructure
preserves both the exponent (by `exponent_preserved_by_bijection`) and the coefficient
values (since energy = ℓ² + 2|μ| and parnum = ℓ under the bijection).

This is the main technical lemma needed to complete `jacobiLHS_mul_partitionGenFun`. -/

/-- Helper lemma for `jacobiLHS_mul_partitionGenFun`: the coefficient sum over (P, N) pairs
equals the coefficient sum over (ℓ, μ) pairs with the `(pair.1^2).natAbs` exponent form.

This bridges the gap between `finsetPair_sum_eq_partition_sum_param` (which uses `pair.1.natAbs^2`)
and the form needed in `jacobiLHS_mul_partitionGenFun` (which uses `(pair.1^2).natAbs`).

The key identity is `(ℓ^2).natAbs = ℓ.natAbs^2` from `Int.natAbs_pow`. -/

/-- The product `jacobiLHSEval * partitionGenFunEval` equals the state generating function.

This is the key step in the LHS computation:

  = ∏_{n>0}((1+q^{2n-1}z)(1+q^{2n-1}z^{-1}))

Using binary expansion, this product equals:
  ∑_{P finite, N finite} q^{∑_{p∈P}(2p-1) + ∑_{n∈N}(2n-1)} z^{|P| - |N|}
  = ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}

The proof uses the binary expansion of the product over positive integers.

  ## Proof Strategy

  The proof follows Borcherds' approach and uses four key steps:

  ### Step 1: Partition Generating Function Identity
  partitionGenFunEval a u = ∏_{k>0}(1 - u^{2k}·X^{2ak})^{-1}

  This is the partition generating function identity with parameters.
  The sum over partitions ∑_{μ} u^{2|μ|}·X^{2a|μ|} equals the inverse product.

  ### Step 2: Cancellation
  jacobiLHSEval has factors (1 - u^{2n}·X^{2na}) which cancel with the
  inverse factors from partitionGenFunEval:

  jacobiLHSEval * partitionGenFunEval
  = ∏_{n>0}((1+c1·X^e1)(1+c2·X^e2)(1-c3·X^e3)) · ∏_{k>0}(1-c3·X^e3)^{-1}
  = ∏_{n>0}((1+c1·X^e1)(1+c2·X^e2))

  ### Step 3: Binary Expansion
  The remaining product expands via binary enumeration:
  ∏_{n>0}((1+a_n)(1+b_n)) = ∑_{P,N ⊆ ℕ finite} (∏_{p∈P} a_p)(∏_{n∈N} b_n)

  This gives the state generating function:
  ∑_{S state} u^{energy(S)} v^{parnum(S)} X^{...}

  ### Step 4: Bijection
  The bijection partitionToState_bijective connects states to pairs (ℓ, μ):
  ∑_{S state} ... = ∑_{(ℓ,μ)} u^{ℓ² + 2|μ|} v^ℓ X^{a(ℓ² + 2|μ|) + bℓ}

  This is the RHS.

    /-
    ## Proof Implementation
    
    The proof mirrors `jacobiRHS_mul_partitionGenFun` but uses the product structure of `jacobiLHSEval`.
    
    Key insight: `jacobiLHSEval = jacobiZZProductParam * eulerProductParam` where:
    - `jacobiZZProductParam` is the product of the first two factors (1+c1·X^e1)(1+c2·X^e2)
    - `eulerProductParam` is the product of the third factors (1-c3·X^e3)
    
    Then using `partitionGenFunEval * eulerProductParam = 1`, we get:
    `jacobiLHSEval * partitionGenFunEval = jacobiZZProductParam`
    
    The proof that `jacobiZZProductParam` equals the state generating function uses binary expansion,
    analogous to `jacobiZZProduct_eq_stateGenFun` for the non-parameterized case.

/-- **Jacobi's Triple Product Identity** (Theorem \ref{thm.pars.jtp2})

The evaluated form of Jacobi's triple product identity:
  jacobiLHSEval a b u v = jacobiRHSEval a b u v

where the LHS is an infinite product and the RHS is an infinite sum.
This is the parameterized version with parameters `a`, `b` (integers with a > 0 and |b| ≤ a)
and `u`, `v` (rational numbers with v ≠ 0).

The proof follows Borcherds' approach via "states" (as presented in Cameron's book, §8.3).
Both sides, when multiplied by the partition generating function, equal the same
"state generating function", allowing cancellation.

See also `jacobi_triple_product_fps'` for the formal power series version (thm.pars.jtp1).

    (u v : ℚ) (hv : v ≠ 0) :
    jacobiLHSEval a b u v = jacobiRHSEval a b u v := by
  /-
  ## Proof Strategy (Borcherds' approach)

  The proof shows that both sides equal the "state generating function"
    ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}
  when multiplied by the partition generating function ∏_{k>0}(1-q^{2k})^{-1}.

  Since the partition generating function is nonzero (it has constant term 1),
  we can cancel it to conclude LHS = RHS.

  ### Key Steps:
  1. Show jacobiRHSEval · partitionGenFunEval = stateGenFun (using bijection)
  2. Show jacobiLHSEval · partitionGenFunEval = stateGenFun (using product expansion)
  3. Conclude jacobiLHSEval = jacobiRHSEval

  The bijection part uses:
  - partitionToState_bijective: (ℓ, μ) ↦ E_{ℓ,μ} is a bijection
  - excitedState_energy: energy(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ² + 2|μ|
  - excitedState_parnum: parnum(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ

  The product expansion part uses the binary expansion of
    ∏_{k>0}((1+q^{2k-1}z)(1+q^{2k-1}z^{-1}))
  which enumerates all states.

  ### State Generating Function

  The key to proving Jacobi's triple product identity is the "state generating function":
    ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}

  Both the LHS and RHS of the identity, when multiplied by the partition generating function
  ∏_{k>0} (1-q^{2k})^{-1}, equal this state generating function.

  For the RHS:
    RHS · ∏_{k>0} (1-q^{2k})^{-1} = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ · ∑_{μ partition} q^{2|μ|}
                                  = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} ∑_{μ partition} q^{ℓ² + 2|μ|} z^ℓ

  By the bijection partitionToState_bijective, this equals:
    ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}

  since energy(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ² + 2|μ| and parnum(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ.

  For the LHS:
    LHS · ∏_{k>0} (1-q^{2k})^{-1} = ∏_{k>0}((1+q^{2k-1}z)(1+q^{2k-1}z^{-1}))

  Using binary expansion, this product equals:
    ∑_{P,N finite} q^{∑_{p∈P}(2p-1) + ∑_{n∈N}(2n-1)} z^{|P| - |N|}

  which is exactly the state generating function.

  ### Technical Note:
  The full proof requires careful handling of infinite products and sums,
  including convergence arguments in the Pi topology on power series.
  The building blocks (bijection lemmas, energy/parnum formulas) are all
  proved below; what remains is the topological/algebraic manipulation.

  See `jacobiRHS_eq_stateGenFun_aux` (defined after State) for the key lemma
  connecting the RHS to the state generating function via the bijection.

/-! ## Alternative Proof Approach: Evaluation Homomorphism

This section provides infrastructure for an alternative proof of `jacobi_triple_product`
that bypasses the file ordering issue in `jacobiLHS_mul_partitionGenFun`.

The idea is to derive `jacobi_triple_product` from `jacobi_triple_product_fps'` 
(which is fully proved later in this file) by constructing an evaluation map from 
`JacobiRing` to `ℚ⟦X⟧` that sends `q^e * z^ℓ` to `u^e * v^ℓ * X^{ae + bℓ}`.

If we can show:
1. `evalJacobi jacobiLHS' = jacobiLHSEval a b u v`
2. `evalJacobi jacobiRHS' = jacobiRHSEval a b u v`

Then `jacobi_triple_product` follows immediately from `jacobi_triple_product_fps'`.

Note: The original analysis was tracked in issue 9a9b6a12 (now resolved and split into
issues 62191a41 and 9dd5829e for focused tracking of the remaining blockers).

/-! ### Corrected evaluation infrastructure

The original `evalJacobi` has a bug: it computes `X^{ae} · X^{(bℓ).toNat}` instead of 
`X^{(ae + bℓ).toNat}`. These differ when `bℓ < 0` but `ae + bℓ ≥ 0`.

We fix this by defining `evalJacobiCorrect` that computes the combined exponent directly.

/-! ### Roadmap for completing jacobi_triple_product via evaluation

The alternative proof approach uses `jacobi_triple_product_fps'` (proved later in this file)
which shows `jacobiLHS' = jacobiRHS'` in `JacobiRing = PowerSeries (LaurentPolynomial ℤ)`.

To derive `jacobi_triple_product` (the evaluated form), we need:

1. **evalJacobiCorrect_jacobiRHS'**: `evalJacobiCorrect a b u v jacobiRHS' = jacobiRHSEval a b u v`
   
   Proof sketch:
   - `jacobiRHS' = ∑' ℓ, jacobiSumTerm ℓ` where `jacobiSumTerm ℓ = X^{ℓ²} · C(T^ℓ)`
   - The coefficient of `q^{ℓ²}` in `jacobiSumTerm ℓ` is `T^ℓ`
   - By `evalLaurentCoeffShifted_T`: evaluation gives `v^ℓ · X^{(aℓ² + bℓ).toNat}`
   - So `evalJacobiCorrect` of `jacobiSumTerm ℓ` is `u^{ℓ²} · v^ℓ · X^{(aℓ² + bℓ).toNat}`
   - Summing over ℓ gives `jacobiRHSEval`

2. **evalJacobiCorrect_jacobiLHS'**: `evalJacobiCorrect a b u v jacobiLHS' = jacobiLHSEval a b u v`
   
   This is more complex because `jacobiLHS'` is an infinite product.
   Proof sketch:
   - `jacobiLHS' = ∏' n, jacobiProductTerm n`
   - Each `jacobiProductTerm n` involves factors `(1 + X^{2n-1} · C(T^1))`, etc.
   - The evaluation preserves products (needs ring homomorphism property)
   - Each factor evaluates to the corresponding factor in `jacobiLHSEval`

3. **jacobi_triple_product_via_evalCorrect**: Alternative proof using evaluation
   ```
   jacobiLHSEval = evalJacobiCorrect jacobiLHS'   -- by evalJacobiCorrect_jacobiLHS'
                 = evalJacobiCorrect jacobiRHS'   -- by jacobi_triple_product_fps'
                 = jacobiRHSEval                  -- by evalJacobiCorrect_jacobiRHS'
   ```

**Current status**: Corrected infrastructure added. The key lemmas need to be proved.
-/

/-- Helper: evalJacobiCorrect applied to a single jacobiSumTerm ℓ gives the ℓ-th term of jacobiRHSEval.

This is the key computation: for jacobiSumTerm ℓ = X^{ℓ²} · C(T^ℓ), we have
  evalJacobiCorrect a b u v (jacobiSumTerm ℓ) = u^{ℓ²} · v^ℓ · X^{(aℓ² + bℓ).toNat}

The proof uses:
- coeff e (jacobiSumTerm ℓ) = T ℓ if e = ℓ², else 0
- evalLaurentCoeffShifted_T: evaluation of T ℓ gives v^ℓ · X^{(ae + bℓ).toNat}
- Only the term at e = ℓ² contributes to the tsum -/

    evalJacobiCorrect a b u v jacobiRHS' = jacobiRHSEval a b u v := by
  /-
  Proof strategy:
  
  1. Both sides are power series in ℚ⟦X⟧. We prove equality by comparing coefficients.
  
  2. For the RHS (jacobiRHSEval):
     - jacobiRHSEval a b u v = ∑' ℓ : ℤ, (u^{ℓ²} * v^ℓ) • X^{(aℓ² + bℓ).toNat}
     - The coefficient of X^n is ∑_{ℓ : (aℓ² + bℓ).toNat = n} u^{ℓ²} * v^ℓ
     - This is a finite sum since only finitely many ℓ satisfy the constraint (a > 0)
  
  3. For the LHS (evalJacobiCorrect of jacobiRHS'):
     - jacobiRHS' = ∑' ℓ : ℤ, jacobiSumTerm ℓ
     - evalJacobiCorrect = ∑' e : ℕ, u^e • evalLaurentCoeffShifted a b v e (coeff e f)
     - coeff e (jacobiSumTerm ℓ) = T ℓ if e = ℓ², else 0 (by coeff_jacobiSumTerm)
     - So coeff e (jacobiRHS') = ∑_{ℓ : ℓ² = e} T ℓ
     - evalLaurentCoeffShifted of T ℓ gives v^ℓ • X^{(ae + bℓ).toNat}
  
  4. The key computation:
     - The LHS coefficient of X^n is a double sum over (e, ℓ with ℓ² = e)
     - This equals ∑_{ℓ : (aℓ² + bℓ).toNat = n} u^{ℓ²} * v^ℓ
     - Which equals the RHS coefficient
  
  5. Technical requirements:
     - Summability in the Pi topology (handled by jacobiSumTerm_summable)
     - Commutativity of coeff with tsum (handled by map_tsum with continuous_coeff)
     - Finiteness of preimages (quadratic with positive leading coefficient)
  
  The helper lemma evalJacobiCorrect_jacobiSumTerm shows that each term matches:
    evalJacobiCorrect a b u v (jacobiSumTerm ℓ) = (u^{ℓ²} * v^ℓ) • X^{(aℓ² + bℓ).toNat}
  
  The main challenge is showing evalJacobiCorrect distributes over the infinite sum,
  which requires careful handling of the Pi topology and summability.

/-! ### State Generating Function Infrastructure

The key to proving Jacobi's triple product identity is the "state generating function":
  ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}

Both the LHS and RHS of the identity, when multiplied by the partition generating function
∏_{k>0} (1-q^{2k})^{-1}, equal this state generating function.

For the RHS:
  RHS · ∏_{k>0} (1-q^{2k})^{-1} = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ · ∑_{μ partition} q^{2|μ|}
                                = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} ∑_{μ partition} q^{ℓ² + 2|μ|} z^ℓ

By the bijection partitionToState_bijective, this equals:
  ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}

since energy(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ² + 2|μ| and parnum(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ.

For the LHS:
  LHS · ∏_{k>0} (1-q^{2k})^{-1} = ∏_{k>0}((1+q^{2k-1}z)(1+q^{2k-1}z^{-1}))

Using binary expansion, this product equals:
  ∑_{P,N finite} q^{∑_{p∈P}(2p-1) + ∑_{n∈N}(2n-1)} z^{|P| - |N|}

which is exactly the state generating function.
-/

/-- Key lemma: The RHS of Jacobi's identity can be rewritten using the bijection.

The sum ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} ∑_{μ partition} q^{ℓ² + 2|μ|} z^ℓ can be reindexed using the bijection
partitionToState_bijective to give ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}.

This is because:
- excitedState_energy: energy(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ² + 2|μ|
- excitedState_parnum: parnum(E_{ℓ,μ}) = ℓ
- partitionToState_bijective: the map (ℓ, μ) ↦ E_{ℓ,μ} is a bijection onto states

This lemma shows that for each (ℓ, μ) pair, the term in the algebraic RHS matches
the corresponding term in the state generating function.

/-! ## Lemma for Substitution -/

/-- **Lemma \ref{lem.fps.fxx=gxx}**: If f[x²] = g[x²], then f = g.

This justifies "substituting x for x²" in the proof of Euler's pentagonal theorem
from Jacobi's triple product identity.

The key insight is: if f = ∑_n f_n x^n and g = ∑_n g_n x^n, then
  f[x²] = ∑_n f_n x^{2n}  and  g[x²] = ∑_n g_n x^{2n}

So if f[x²] = g[x²], comparing x^{2n}-coefficients gives f_n = g_n for all n,
hence f = g.

Here f[x²] denotes the substitution of x² for x in f, i.e., `PowerSeries.subst (X^2) f`.
This substitution is well-defined because X² has zero constant coefficient,
satisfying the `HasSubst` condition.

/-! ## Transfer from ℚ to ℤ for Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem

The proof of Euler's pentagonal number theorem proceeds by:
1. Proving the identity over ℚ using Jacobi's triple product
2. Transferring from ℚ to ℤ using the fact that both sides have integer coefficients

The key lemma `eulerProduct_coeff_map` shows that the coefficients of `eulerProduct`
are compatible with the ring homomorphism ℤ → ℚ.

/-! ## Connecting Lemmas for Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem

These lemmas connect `jacobiLHSEval` and `jacobiRHSEval` at the specific parameters
(a=3, b=1, u=1, v=-1) to `eulerProduct` and `pentagonalSeries` respectively.
Together with `jacobi_triple_product` and `fps_eq_of_sq_eq`, they complete the proof
of Euler's pentagonal number theorem.
-/

/-- The LHS of Jacobi's triple product at (a=3, b=1, u=1, v=-1) equals eulerProduct[x²].

When we set a=3, b=1, u=1, v=-1 in jacobiLHSEval, we get:
  ∏_{n>0} ((1 + 1^{2n-1}·(-1)·x^{(2n-1)·3+1}) · (1 + 1^{2n-1}·(-1)^{-1}·x^{(2n-1)·3-1}) · (1 - 1^{2n}·x^{2n·3}))
  = ∏_{n>0} ((1 - x^{6n-2}) · (1 - x^{6n-4}) · (1 - x^{6n}))

The exponents 6n-2, 6n-4, 6n for n = 1, 2, 3, ... give all positive even integers:
  n=1: 4, 2, 6 → {2, 4, 6}
  n=2: 10, 8, 12 → {8, 10, 12}
  n=3: 16, 14, 18 → {14, 16, 18}
  ...

So this equals ∏_{k>0} (1 - x^{2k}) = ∏_{k>0} (1 - (x²)^k) = eulerProduct[x²].

Note: This uses the fact that for each positive integer k, exactly one of 6n-2, 6n-4, 6n
equals 2k for some positive integer n. This is because:
  - 2k ≡ 0 (mod 6) ⟹ 2k = 6n for n = k/3
  - 2k ≡ 2 (mod 6) ⟹ 2k = 6n - 4 for n = (k+2)/3
  - 2k ≡ 4 (mod 6) ⟹ 2k = 6n - 2 for n = (k+1)/3

/-- The RHS of Jacobi's triple product at (a=3, b=1, u=1, v=-1) equals pentagonalSeries[x²].

When we set a=3, b=1, u=1, v=-1 in jacobiRHSEval, we get:
  ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} 1^{ℓ²} · (-1)^ℓ · x^{3ℓ² + ℓ}
  = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} (-1)^ℓ · x^{3ℓ² + ℓ}

The infinite product equals the alternating sum of powers at pentagonal numbers:
  ∏_{k=1}^∞ (1 - x^k) = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k}

Concretely:
  = 1 - x - x² + x⁵ + x⁷ - x¹² - x¹⁵ + x²² + x²⁶ ∓ ...

The proof transfers from ℚ to ℤ using `euler_pentagonal_number_theorem_rat` and
the fact that both sides have integer coefficients.

/-- **Corollary \ref{cor.pars.pn-rec}**: Recursive formula for partition numbers.

For each positive integer n:
  p(n) = ∑_{k∈ℤ, k≠0} (-1)^{k-1} p(n - w_k)
       = p(n-1) + p(n-2) - p(n-5) - p(n-7) + p(n-12) + p(n-15) - ...

where p(m) = 0 for m < 0.

Note: The sign (-1)^{k-1} is computed using `(k.natAbs + 1) % 2` to handle
negative k correctly. For k ≠ 0, (-1)^{k-1} equals (-1)^{|k|-1} = (-1)^{|k|+1}.

/-- **Key Combinatorial Identity**: n * p(n) = ∑_{k=1}^n σ_1(k) * p(n-k)

This identity relates the partition function p(n) to the sum of divisors function σ_1.

## Proof Approaches

### 1. Logarithmic Derivative (Classical)
Since P = ∏_{k≥1} 1/(1-X^k), we have:
- log(P) = -∑_{k≥1} log(1-X^k) = ∑_{k≥1} ∑_{m≥1} X^{km}/m
- X * d/dX log(P) = ∑_{k≥1} ∑_{m≥1} k * X^{km} = ∑_{n≥1} σ_1(n) * X^n = S
- Since d/dX log(P) = P'/P, we get X * P'/P = S, hence X * P' = S * P.

This approach requires PowerSeries.log which is not yet in Mathlib.

### 2. Combinatorial Bijection
The identity can be proved by establishing a bijection between:
- **Type A**: Pairs (λ, cell) where λ partitions n and cell ∈ {1,...,n} marks a cell in the Young diagram
- **Type B**: Quadruples (d, m, j, μ) where:
  - d ≥ 1 is a part size
  - m ≥ 1 is a multiplicity (so md ≤ n)
  - j ∈ {1,...,d} is a position within a row
  - μ partitions n - md

The bijection:
- **Forward**: (λ, cell) → (d, m, j, μ) where d = length of row containing cell,
  m = count of d-rows in λ, j = position of cell in its row, μ = λ minus all d-rows
- **Backward**: (d, m, j, μ) → (λ, cell) where λ = μ plus m rows of length d,
  cell = position j in the first new row

Counting:
- |Type A| = n * p(n) (n cells per partition, p(n) partitions)
- |Type B| = ∑_{d,m: md≤n} d * p(n-md) = ∑_{k=1}^n (∑_{d|k} d) * p(n-k) = ∑_{k=1}^n σ_1(k) * p(n-k)

### 3. Direct Verification
One can verify the identity directly by computing both sides for each n,
using the recursive formula for p(n) from Euler's pentagonal theorem.

## Note
This lemma is the key remaining piece for proving `euler_sum_divisors_recursive`.
The bijection approach is the most elementary but requires formalizing Young diagrams
and cell positions. The logarithmic derivative approach is cleaner but requires
infrastructure for power series logarithms.

  -- - LHS counts pairs (λ, cell) where λ is a partition of n and cell ∈ {1,...,n}
  -- - RHS counts quadruples (d, m, j, μ) where d ≥ 1, m ≥ 1, dm ≤ n, j ∈ {1,...,d},
  --   and μ is a partition of n - dm
  --
  -- The bijection maps (λ, cell) to (d, m, j, μ) where:
  -- - d = size of the part containing the cell
  -- - m = number of parts of size d in λ
  -- - j = position of the cell within its part
  -- - μ = λ with all parts of size d removed
  --
  -- Both sides count the same set because:
  -- - For each partition λ of n, the number of cells is n = ∑_d d * mult_d(λ)
  -- - So n * p(n) = ∑_λ n = ∑_λ ∑_d d * mult_d(λ) = ∑_d d * ∑_λ mult_d(λ)

This is equivalent to the classical identity: n * p(n) = ∑_{k=1}^n σ(k) * p(n-k)

The proof follows from the logarithmic derivative of the partition generating function.
Since P = ∏_{k≥1} 1/(1-x^k), we have:
  log(P) = -∑_{k≥1} log(1-x^k) = ∑_{k≥1} ∑_{m≥1} x^{km}/m
  X * d/dx log(P) = ∑_{k≥1} ∑_{m≥1} k * x^{km} = ∑_{n≥1} σ(n) * x^n = S

/-- Coefficient extraction for -Q * S.
The coefficient of x^n in -Q*S equals the negative of the sum over all k with w_k < n
of (-1)^|k| * σ(n - w_k).

## Proof outline

The proof uses the convolution formula for power series multiplication:
  [x^n](Q * S) = ∑_{a+b=n} [x^a]Q * [x^b]S

Since [x^0]S = 0 (the sigma series has no constant term), only pairs with b > 0 contribute.
For each such pair (a, b) with a + b = n and b > 0:
- [x^a]Q = pentagonalCoeff(a) is nonzero only when a = pentagonalNumber(k) for some k
- When a = pentagonalNumber(k), [x^a]Q = (-1)^|k|
- We have b = n - a = n - pentagonalNumber(k)
- [x^b]S = σ(b) = σ(n - pentagonalNumber(k))

The sum over (a, b) with a pentagonal can be reindexed to a sum over k with w_k < n.
The condition w_k < n ensures b = n - w_k > 0 (so σ(b) is well-defined).

The tsum over the finite subtype {k : ℤ // pentagonalNumber k < n} equals a Finset.sum
because the subtype is finite (by `pentagonal_below_fintype`). -/

/-- **Theorem \ref{thm.pars.euler-sum-div-rec}**: Euler's recursion for the sum of divisors.

For each positive integer n:
  ∑_{k∈ℤ, w_k < n} (-1)^k σ(n - w_k) =
    { (-1)^{k-1} n,  if n = w_k for some k ∈ ℤ
    { 0,            otherwise

where σ(n) is the sum of all positive divisors of n.

The proof compares coefficients of x^n in the identity x * Q' = -Q * S, where
Q is the pentagonal series and S is the sum of divisors generating function.

Note: The sign (-1)^k is computed using `k.natAbs` to handle negative k correctly.
For any integer k, (-1)^k = (-1)^|k| since (-1)^{-m} = (-1)^m.
Similarly, (-1)^{k-1} = (-1)^{|k|+1} for k ≠ 0.

## Proof Strategy (from tex source)

The proof requires Euler's pentagonal number theorem (`euler_pentagonal_number_theorem`)
which states: ∏_{k≥1} (1 - x^k) = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k}

The key identity used is: xQ' = -QS where
- Q = ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k x^{w_k} (pentagonal series)
- S = ∑_{n>0} σ(n) x^n (sum of divisors generating function)
- P = ∑_{n≥0} p(n) x^n (partition generating function)

This is derived from:
1. PQ = 1 (from Euler's pentagonal theorem and partition generating function)
2. xP' = SP (identity relating partition function derivative to σ)
3. Taking derivatives and using PQ = 1 gives xQ' = -QS

Then comparing coefficients of x^n on both sides of
  ∑_{k∈ℤ} (-1)^k w_k x^{w_k} = -QS
gives the result.

/-- The coefficient of X^d in the double sum over (P, N) pairs equals
the coefficient of X^d in the state generating function.

This is the key lemma connecting the binary expansion of the Jacobi product
to the state generating function. The proof uses the bijection:
  (P, N) ↔ State S ↔ (ℓ, μ)
where energy and parnum are preserved.

This is documented in tex source lines 500-570 of PentagonalJacobi.tex.

/-- Key lemma 3: ZZProduct = stateGenFun (binary expansion).
The product ∏_{n>0}((1+q^{2n-1}z)(1+q^{2n-1}z^{-1})) expands via binary
enumeration to the state generating function ∑_{S state} q^{energy(S)} z^{parnum(S)}.

This is because:
- The product over positive levels (1+q^{2p}z) for p > 0 gives ∑_{P finite} ∏_{p∈P} q^{2p}z
- The product over negative levels (1+q^{-2p}z^{-1}) for p < 0 gives ∑_{N finite} ∏_{p∈N} q^{-2p}z^{-1}
- Combining these gives the state generating function via the bijection between
  pairs (P, N) and states.

/-- **Jacobi's Triple Product Identity** (Theorem \ref{thm.pars.jtp1})

In the ring (ℤ[z^±])[[q]], we have:
  ∏_{n>0} ((1 + q^{2n-1}z)(1 + q^{2n-1}z^{-1})(1 - q^{2n})) = ∑_{ℓ∈ℤ} q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ

This is the main form of Jacobi's triple product identity, stated in the ring
JacobiRing = (ℤ[z^±])[[q]] = PowerSeries (LaurentPolynomial ℤ).

The left-hand side `jacobiLHS'` is the infinite product defined using:
- `jacobiZ` = T(1), the indeterminate z
- `jacobiZInv` = T(-1), the inverse z⁻¹
- `jacobiProductTerm n` = (1 + q^{2n+1}z)(1 + q^{2n+1}z⁻¹)(1 - q^{2(n+1)})

The right-hand side `jacobiRHS'` is the infinite sum:
- `jacobiSumTerm ℓ` = q^{ℓ²} z^ℓ

**Note**: The identity is stated in the specific ring JacobiRing with:
- q = X (the power series indeterminate)
- z = T(1) (the Laurent polynomial indeterminate)

A parameterized version `jacobiLHS q z` for arbitrary q, z would be mathematically
ill-formed because z⁻¹ does not exist for arbitrary z. The identity only makes
sense when z is invertible, which is the case in JacobiRing where z = T(1).

The proof uses Borcherds' approach via states and energy/particle number,
as implemented in the State infrastructure above.

theorem jacobi_triple_product_fps' : jacobiLHS' = jacobiRHS' := by
  -- Use the key lemmas: both LHS and RHS equal stateGenFun when multiplied by partitionGenFunJacobi
  have h_lhs := stateGenFun_eq_jacobiLHS'_mul_partitionGenFunJacobi
  have h_rhs := stateGenFun_eq_jacobiRHS'_mul_partitionGenFunJacobi
  -- Since both products equal stateGenFun, they are equal to each other
  have h_eq : jacobiLHS' * partitionGenFunJacobi = jacobiRHS' * partitionGenFunJacobi := by
    rw [← h_lhs, ← h_rhs]
  -- partitionGenFunJacobi is a unit (has constant term 1), so we can cancel it

/-- Evaluation of jacobiLHS' using the corrected evaluation gives jacobiLHSEval.

This proof uses the chain:
- `jacobi_triple_product_fps'`: `jacobiLHS' = jacobiRHS'`
- `evalJacobiCorrect_jacobiRHS'`: `evalJacobiCorrect jacobiRHS' = jacobiRHSEval`
- `jacobi_triple_product`: `jacobiLHSEval = jacobiRHSEval`

The lemma is placed here (after `jacobi_triple_product_fps'`) because it depends on that theorem
which was not available at the original location in the file.

/-- Alternative proof of Jacobi's triple product identity using the corrected evaluation homomorphism.

This proof derives `jacobi_triple_product` from `jacobi_triple_product_fps'` (which is fully proved)
by showing that the corrected evaluation map sends `jacobiLHS'` to `jacobiLHSEval` and `jacobiRHS'` to 
`jacobiRHSEval`.

This approach bypasses the file ordering issue in `jacobiLHS_mul_partitionGenFun` by using
the independent proof path through the State infrastructure.

Note: This uses `evalJacobiCorrect` which computes combined exponents correctly, unlike
the original `evalJacobi` which has truncation issues with negative intermediate exponents.
